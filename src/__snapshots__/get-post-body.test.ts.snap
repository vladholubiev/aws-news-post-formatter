"<p>We are excited to announce today that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds">Amazon RDS</a> is lowering prices globally for Single-AZ and Multi-AZ deployments. These price reductions follow a series of innovations we have launched recently (described later in this announcement). </p>
<p>We have reduced the On-Demand prices by as much as 18% for MySQL and Oracle BYOL (Bring Your Own License) and 28% for SQL Server BYOL. All of your On-Demand usage will automatically be charged at the new and lower rates effective June 1, 2013. </p>
<p>We have also reduced the Reserved Instance (RI) prices by as much as 27% for MySQL and Oracle BYOL. The new prices apply to Reserved Instance purchases made on or after June 11, 2013. With the new pricing, Reserved Instances will provide savings of up to 76% compared to On-Demand instances, so you may want to take this opportunity to review your usage and decide whether to purchase additional Reserved Instances to take advantage of these savings. </p>
<p>For your quick reference, new On-Demand prices for an M1.Small DB instance, and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for an M2.Xlarge DB instance using a 3-Year Heavy Utilization RI are shown in the tables below:</p>

<p>Not only do we constantly strive to drive costs down so as to pass those savings on to you, but we also innovate quickly with new features that enable your important use cases. Following is the list of a few key features:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/#PIOPS"> Up to 30K of Provisioned IOPS </a> to meet the performance needs of I/O-intensive, transactional (OLTP) database workloads.</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/oracle/#VPC"> Data encryption at-rest using Oracle's Transparent Data Encryption </a> to satisfy enterprise security and compliance requirements.</li>
<li><a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/10/amazon-rds-for-mysql-promote-read-replica.html">Read-replica promotion </a> to enable disaster recovery in the event the master is degraded.</li>
<li><a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/03/amazon-rds-access-to-database-log-files.html"> Point-and-click access to database logs </a> to facilitate troubleshooting of database issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>These features are used by many of our customers who run production workloads on RDS today. And, last week’s announcement of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds-sla">RDS Service Level Agreement (SLA) </a> for Multi-AZ database instances was designed to give you additional confidence to run the most demanding and mission critical workloads dependably on RDS. </p>"

<p>C5 instances are optimized for compute-intensive workloads and deliver cost-effective high performance at a low price per compute ratio. These instances are ideal for high-performance computing (HPC), machine learning, deep inference, distributed analytics, batch processing, and much more. With the new 24xlarge size, C5 instances increases available resources by 33% to provide even more resources and performance for those compute intensive workloads.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new C5 bare metal option provides your applications with direct access to the processor and memory resources of the underlying server. Bare metal instances are ideal for workloads that require access to the hardware feature set (such as Intel® VT-x), for applications that need to run in non-virtualized environments for licensing or support requirements, or for customers who wish to use their own hypervisor.</p>
<p>c5.12xl, c5.24xl, and c5.metal instances are available today in the following AWS regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (Frankfurt, Ireland, London, Paris, Stockholm), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and AWS GovCloud (US). C5 instances are available in 8 sizes, with 2, 4, 8, 16, 36, 48, 72, and 96 vCPUs and are purchasable as On-Demand, Reserved, Spot and as Dedicated Instances.  </p>

"<p>We have good news to share. Effective at the beginning of this month (February 1, 2013), Amazon RDS is lowering Multi-AZ deployment prices globally for MySQL and Oracle editions. </p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/multi-az"> Amazon RDS Multi-AZ </a> deployments offer enhanced availability for your production database workloads. When a database is run as a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS operates a standby instance which maintains an up-to-date copy of the primary database. In case of an instance, storage, or network failure, Amazon RDS automatically initiates a failover from the primary to the standby. This ensures minimal database availability impact to your application. </p>
<p>Today, many customers run production workloads on Amazon RDS as Multi-AZ deployments. However, we also know that there are many customers who‘ve wanted to run Amazon RDS Multi-AZ but haven’t been able to do so yet at the current price. So, we’re excited to lower our Amazon RDS Multi-AZ to make it even easier for customers to run production databases on Amazon RDS as Multi-AZ deployments. </p>

"<p>Amazon SageMaker now supports new capabilities for better orchestration, experimentation, and collaboration for machine learning (ML) workflows. AWS Step Functions is now integrated with Amazon SageMaker and AWS Glue, making it easier to build, deploy, monitor, and iterate ML workflows. Using AWS Step Functions, you can now automate ML workflows by connecting multiple Amazon SageMaker jobs in a few minutes, and with less code. We now have a new capability to help you organize, track, and evaluate your ML training experiments with Amazon SageMaker Search, that is available in beta starting today. Lastly, you can now associate GitHUb, AWS CodeCommit, and any self-hosted Git repository with Amazon SageMaker notebook instances to easily and securely collaborate and ensure version-control with Jupyter notebooks. Visit the AWS Step Functions <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/">documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Typically, automating ML workflows involves writing and maintaining code to define the workflow logic, monitor the completion of each job, and address any errors. ML models need to be managed for large datasets before deploying them into production environments. Re-deployment is required every time a model changes, and multiple teams are required to ensure that the model is performing as expected. This entire process is complex and can slow down delivery of applications. With the integration of AWS Step Functions and Amazon SageMaker, you can automate the publishing of large, diverse datasets into an Amazon S3 data lake, train ML models, and deploy these models into production. AWS Step Functions can sequence and run jobs in parallel, and automatically retry any failed jobs. The integration includes built-in error handling, passing of parameters, and state management. This enables acceleration for the delivery of secure, resilient ML applications, while reducing the amount of code that you have to write and maintain. </p>
<p>Developing a successful ML model requires continuous experimentation, trying new algorithms and hyperparameters, all the while observing any impact to performance and accuracy. This makes it difficult to track the unique combination of datasets, algorithms, and parameters to achieve the winning model. You can now organize, track, and evaluate your machine learning model training experiments with Amazon SageMaker Search. SageMaker Search helps you quickly find and evaluate the most relevant model training runs from the potentially thousands of model training runs, right from the AWS management console and through the AWS SDK for Amazon SageMaker. Search is available in beta in 13 AWS regions where Amazon SageMaker is currently available. See the blog <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-sagemaker-now-comes-with-new-capabilities-for-accelerating-machine-learning-experimentation/">here</a> for more information.</p>
<p>It is often required to share ideas, tasks, and collaborate to make progress with machine learning. The de-facto standard for collaboration with traditional software development has been version control, which plays an important role in machine learning as well. It is now possible to associate GitHub, AWS Code Commit, and any self-hosted Git repository with Amazon SageMaker notebook instances to easily and securely collaborate and ensure version-control with Jupyter notebooks. Using Git repositories with Jupyter notebooks, it is easy to co-author project, track code changes, and combine software engineering and data science practices for production-ready code management. You can easily discover, execute, and share machine learning and deep learning techniques that are provided on Jupyter notebooks and hosted in GitHub. See the blog <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-sagemaker-notebooks-now-support-git-integration-for-increased-persistence-collaboration-and-reproducibility/">here</a> for more information. </p>
<p>Typically, automating ML workflows involves writing and maintaining code to define the workflow logic, monitor the completion of each job, and address any errors. ML models need to be managed for large datasets before deploying them into production environments. Re-deployment is required every time a model changes, and multiple teams are required to ensure that the model is performing as expected. This entire process is complex and can slow down delivery of applications. With the integration of AWS Step Functions and Amazon SageMaker, you can automate the publishing of large, diverse datasets into an Amazon S3 data lake, train ML models, and deploy these models into production. AWS Step Functions can sequence and run jobs in parallel, and automatically retry any failed jobs. The integration includes built-in error handling, passing of parameters, and state management. This enables acceleration for the delivery of secure, resilient ML applications, while reducing the amount of code that you have to write and maintain. </p>
<p>Developing a successful ML model requires continuous experimentation, trying new algorithms and hyperparameters, all the while observing any impact to performance and accuracy. This makes it difficult to track the unique combination of datasets, algorithms, and parameters to achieve the winning model. You can now organize, track, and evaluate your machine learning model training experiments with Amazon SageMaker Search. SageMaker Search helps you quickly find and evaluate the most relevant model training runs from the potentially thousands of model training runs, right from the AWS management console and through the AWS SDK for Amazon SageMaker. Search is available in beta in 13 AWS regions where Amazon SageMaker is currently available. See the blog here for more information.</p>

"<p>Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) is a new version of the Internet Protocol that uses a larger address space than its predecessor IPv4. With IPv6 support, you will be able to meet the requirements for IPv6 adoption set by governments, remove the need for IPv6 to IPv4 translation software or systems, and benefit from IPv6 extensibility, simplicity in network management, and additional built-in support for security</p>
<p><strong>Amazon CloudFront</strong><br />
 We are pleased to announce that starting today you can use Amazon CloudFront to deliver your content both via IPv6 and IPv4 using HTTP/HTTPS with the same security, availability, performance and scalability you have come to expect from Amazon CloudFront. IPv6 will be enabled by default for all newly created Amazon CloudFront web distributions starting today. For existing web distributions, you can enable IPv6 through the Amazon CloudFront console or API. Viewers and networks that connect to Amazon CloudFront edge locations over IPv6 will automatically be served content over IPv6. Those that connect over IPv4 will continue to work. Connections to your origin servers will remain on IPv4. </p>
<p>Starting today, AWS WAF also supports IPv6. If you use AWS WAF in conjunction with Amazon CloudFront, you can now update your web access control lists (WebACLs) and IP rulesets to blacklist/whitelist IPv6 address. If you use Amazon Route 53 for your DNS needs, you can create Amazon Route 53 alias records pointing to your Amazon CloudFront distribution to support both IPv4 and IPv6 by using “A” and “AAAA” record type respectively.   </p>
<p>All existing features of Amazon CloudFront will continue to work on IPv6, though there are two changes you may need for internal IPv6 address processing before you turn on IPv6 for your distributions. First, if you have turned on Amazon CloudFront access logs, you will start seeing your viewer’s IPv6 address in the “c-ip” field and may need to verify that your log processing systems continue to work for IPv6. Second, when you enable IPv6 for your Amazon CloudFront distribution, you will get IPv6 addresses in the ‘X-Forwarded-For’ header that is sent to your origins. If your origin systems are only able to process IPv4 addresses, you may need to verify that your origin systems continue to work for IPv6. Additionally, if you use IP whitelists for Trusted Signers, you should use an IPv4-only distribution for your Trusted Signer URLs with IP whitelists and an IPv4 / IPv6 distribution for all other content. This model sidesteps an issue that would arise if the signing request arrived over an IPv4 address and was signed as such, only to have the request for the content arrive via a different IPv6 address that is not on the whitelist.  </p>
<p>We are enabling IPv6 across every Autonomous System (AS) in a phased rollout starting today and expect to complete rollout across all networks over the next few weeks. To learn more about IPv6 support in Amazon CloudFront, see “<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/cloudfront/ipv6">IPv6 support on Amazon CloudFront</a>” in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/faqs">FAQs</a>.  </p>
<p>We would also like to invite you to join the upcoming webinar on “Delivering secure content with Amazon CloudFront”, in which we will cover how Amazon CloudFront automatically meets the new iOS App Transport Secure (ATS) requirements and enables easy, economical SSL/TLS management with the AWS Certificate Manager. This webinar will occur on Tuesday, October 18, 2016, 10:00AM PDT and you can register <a href="https://webservices.webex.com/webservices/onstage/g.php?MTID=e0cbff6ac2d898237002377681bcb92db">here</a>.

<p><strong>AWS WAF</strong><br />
 With AWS WAF, you can now inspect and act on HTTP/HTTPS requests coming from both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. You can also setup new IPv6 match condition(s) for new and existing Web Access Control Lists (ACLs). You will be able to use all the existing features for traffic both over IPv6 and IPv4 without any changes to either performance, scalability or availability of the service. To learn more about IPv6 support in AWS WAF, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-ip-conditions.html">here</a> in the AWS WAF Developer Guide.</p>
<p>We would also like to invite you to join the upcoming AWS WAF webinar on “Setup Preconfigured Protections on AWS WAF” on Tuesday, November 8, 2016 10:30 AM PST. This session will introduce AWS WAF, how it integrates with other AWS services and how to use it to help protect your web applications. We will also demo how to deploy preconfigured rules and security automation on AWS WAF. Register <a href="https://connect.awswebcasts.com/nov16awswaf/event/registration.html?campaign-id=ServicePage">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration</strong><br />
Your applications can now connect to Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration endpoints for object storage over IPv6. This release follows Amazon S3’s recently added support for IPv6 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/08/internet-protocol-version-6-ipv6-support-for-amazon-s3/">announcement</a>. You can get started using this new feature by enabling Transfer Acceleration on a bucket and then pointing your application to Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration’s new “dual-stack” endpoint (e.g., http://<bucketname>.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com), which supports access over both IPv4 and IPv6. In most cases, no further configuration is required for access over IPv6, because most network clients prefer IPv6 addresses by default. However, you must evaluate your bucket and Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to ensure that you have the appropriate access configured for your new IPv6 addresses. To learn more about using IPv6 with Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html#transfer-acceleration-getting-started">Getting Started with Transfer Acceleration</a>.</p>
<p>With these services and features, IPv6 will be available at no additional charge.  </p>

"<p>The new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/inspector">Amazon Inspector</a> is a vulnerability management service that continually scans AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure is generally available, globally. Amazon Inspector has been completely rearchitected to automate vulnerability management and deliver near real-time findings to minimize the time to discover new vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>With the new Amazon Inspector you can now enable the service across your organization with a single click. Once enabled, Inspector automatically discovers all of your workloads and continually scans them for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure. Now that Inspector supports <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">Amazon Elastic Container Registry</a> (ECR), you gain a consolidated view of vulnerabilities across your Amazon EC2 instances and container images residing in ECR. Inspector now uses the widely-adopted Amazon Systems Manager (SSM) agent for EC2 vulnerability scanning. To intelligently prioritize vulnerability findings, the new Inspector introduces a highly contextualized Inspector risk score by correlating vulnerability information with environmental factors. The Inspector findings are also routed to Amazon Security Hub and pushed to Amazon EventBridge to automate with partner solutions to reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR).</p>
<p><strong>Uber</strong><br />
“The new Amazon Inspector made it easy to adopt a cloud vulnerability management solution for our diverse AWS instances. By leveraging our already in use Systems Manager agents with Inspector, we automated continuous remediation and simplified operations with one-click onboarding, centralized controls, and operational visibility.”, Oliver Szimmetat, Security Engineering Manager II, Uber, “Additionally, Inspector’s auto trigger capability identifies recommended patches in near-real time. After patching, Inspector automatically rescans instances verifying that no new vulnerabilities were introduced. The use of Inspector has drastically reduced the mean time to remediate for Uber.”  </p>
<p><strong>Volkswagen Financial Services</strong><br />
“The new Amazon Inspector made it very easy for us to adopt a vulnerability management solution to support our software patching program and to detect vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized AWS access.”, said Stefan Klünker and Crispin Weißfuß, Global AWS Platform Owners, Volkswagen Financial Services, “Enabling the service to scan both our EC2 and ECR environments for software vulnerabilities was made seamless using CloudFormation. In addition, since Inspector is integrated with AWS Organizations, our 1300+ existing and newly added accounts are automatically onboarded to the service. Inspector discovers all our workloads, continually scans them, consolidates a prioritized list of findings in its console, and it reduces our mean time to remediate with near-immediate notifications of new critical vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the Amazon EventBridge integration enables us to quickly inform development teams about the resources with critical vulnerabilities.”</p>
<p><strong>Canva</strong><br />
"We have a dynamic AWS environment, with new accounts, configurations, and resources added and removed on a regular basis,” said Paul Clarke, Head of Security at Canva. “Historically, this made it a challenge to ensure we are continuously assessing all resources for vulnerabilities, requiring multiple products with a high maintenance overhead. The new Amazon Inspector helps address this problem, supporting vulnerability scanning for both EC2 instances and containers. Since Inspector integrates with AWS Organizations, all our existing and new accounts are also immediately using the service. The service discovers all our workloads, continually scans them using data from multiple vulnerability notification sources, consolidates a prioritized list of findings in its console, and allows us to focus on vulnerability remediation, rather than managing multiple discovery tools and configurations.”</p>
<p>Amazon Inspector has partnered with Snyk to receive additional vulnerability intelligence for its vulnerability database. Many AWS Security ISV Partners have integrated their products to further help customers operationalize Inspector findings, including Axonius, Cavirin, FireEye, IBM Security, Palo Alto Networks, Rezilion, Sophos, SumoLogic, Vulcan Cyber, Wiz and XM Cyber*.* Additionally, AWS Level 1 MSSP Partners such as Cloudhesive, Deloitte offer their customers a service to manage Inspector findings.</p>
<p>Amazon Inspector is now generally available globally across 19 commercial regions, Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Europe (Ireland), US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Stockholm), Europe (Milan), Europe (London), Europe (Paris), Middle East (Bahrain), South America (Sao Paulo), US West (N.

"<p>You can now run OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards version 1.3 on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service">Amazon OpenSearch Service</a>. This version includes several new features and improvements around observability, SQL and PPL, Alerting and Anomaly Detection. You can upgrade your domain seamlessly to OpenSearch version 1.3 from any of the previous OpenSearch versions, or from Elasticsearch versions 6.8 or 7.x directly, using the OpenSearch Service console or APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://opensearch.org/">OpenSearch</a> is a community-driven, open source search and analytics suite derived from Apache 2.0 licensed Elasticsearch 7.10.2 &amp; Kibana 7.10.2. It consists of a data store, search engine (OpenSearch), and a user interface for visualization (OpenSearch Dashboards) . See our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/the-elk-stack/what-is-opensearch">frequently asked questions</a> about OpenSearch.</p>
<p>We launched OpenSearch 1.0 in September 2021 and renamed our service to Amazon OpenSearch Service. As part of OpenSearch 1.0 launch in OpenSearch Service, we maintained backward compatibility to ensure you can upgrade from legacy Elasticsearch versions (until v7.10) to OpenSearch seamlessly. For a summary of changes that we did as part of OpenSearch 1.0 launch and the renaming, please see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/rename.html">documentation</a>. We have added several new features and improvements as part of various OpenSearch versions since then, such as transforms, data streams, notebooks in OpenSearch Dashboards, cross-cluster replication, improvements to anomaly detection, k-NN, and observability. With OpenSearch 1.3 we are adding the following improvements and new features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observability</strong>: Users can now create custom Observability Applications to view the availability status of all their systems by providing a single view of system health, empowering developers and IT Ops to resolve issues faster and with fewer escalations. Some of the new features include the ability to get a unified view of logs, traces, and metrics with <a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/1.3/observability-plugin/app-analytics/">Application analytics dashboards</a>, the ability to use correlation ID (based on the <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/logs/overview/#log-correlation">OpenTelemetry specification</a>) to tie events together when viewing events and in-context visualisations, improvements to <a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/1.3/observability-plugin/event-analytics/">event analysis</a> capabilities such as the ability to monitor a live tail of logs during an event, and view surrounding events to get a correlated picture of a metric. Refer to <a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/1.3/observability-plugin/index/">observability documentation</a> for more information.</li>
<li><strong>PPL and SQL Improvements</strong>: PPL now supports run-time fields, which gives users the ability to define their schema when querying their index (instead of formatting during writing), allowing them to improve indexing time, and provides better presentation flexibility. In addition, we have several improvements to SQL and PPL capabilities such as support for ORDER BY and IN clause, ability to query multiple indices using comma separated values using PPL, and ability to change datatypes using CAST function in PPL. For a complete list of PPL and SQL improvements, see the OpenSearch 1.3 <a href="https://opensearch.org/blog/releases/2022/03/launch-announcement-1-3-0/">release notes</a>. Refer to the <a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/1.3/observability-plugin/ppl/commands/">PPL commands documentation</a> and <a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/1.3/search-plugins/sql/basic/#syntax">SQL queries documentation</a> for more information.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Mode for Transforms</strong>: You can now run transforms in a continuous mode based on a <a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/im-plugin/index-transforms/index/#step-3-specify-a-schedule">schedule</a>. This enables you to keep an incremental transform job running on a group of source indices actively ingesting new data. At each run, only the modified buckets will be transformed, reducing the overhead for users who want to their transform up to date.</li>
<li><strong>Cluster Metric Monitors</strong>: Users can now create monitors within Alerts which help administrators feel more confident about managing the health of their clusters. The new monitor reports on dimensions including, but not limited to CPU usage, Java Virtual Machine (JVM) memory usage, and total number of documents coming into the cluster. Refer to documentation on <a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/1.3/monitoring-plugins/alerting/monitors/#create-cluster-metrics-monitor">cluster metrics monitoring</a> for more information.</li>
<li><strong>New Detector Validation</strong>: We have now added an additional validation when setting up a new anomaly detector. Parameters specified as part of the detector will be validated to ensure that the criteria can initialize and that the detector will perform. Refer to <a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/1.3/monitoring-plugins/ad/index/">anomaly detection documentation</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenSearch 1.3 is now available on Amazon OpenSearch Service across 26 regions globally. Please refer to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services">AWS Region Table</a> for more information about Amazon OpenSearch Service availability.</p>

"<p>We’re excited to announce two new forecasting APIs for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/forecast">Amazon Forecast</a> that generate up to 40% more accurate forecasts and help you understand which factors, such as price, holidays, weather, or item category, are most influencing your forecasts. Forecast uses machine learning (ML) to generate more accurate demand forecasts, without requiring any ML experience. Forecast brings the same technology used at Amazon to developers as a fully managed service, removing the need to manage resources.  </p>
<p>With today’s launch of the new <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API%5FCreateAutoPredictor.html">CreateAutoPredictor API</a>, Forecast can now forecast up to 40% more accurate results by using a combination of ML algorithms that are best suited for your data. In many scenarios, ML experts train separate models for different parts of their dataset to improve forecasting accuracy. This process of segmenting your data and applying different algorithms can be very challenging for non-ML experts. Forecast uses ML to learn not only the best algorithm for each item, but the best ensemble of algorithms for each item, leading to up to 40% better accuracy on forecasts.  </p>
<p>Previously, you would have to train your entire forecasting model again if you were bringing in recent data to use the latest insights before forecasting for the next period. This can be a time-consuming process. Most Forecast customers deploy their forecasting workflows within their operations such as an inventory management solution and run their operations at a set cadence. Because retraining on the entire data can be time-consuming, customer operations may get delayed. With today’s launch, you can save up to 50% of retraining time by selecting to incrementally retrain your AutoPredictor models with the new information that you have added.  </p>
<p>Lastly, an AutoPredictor forecasting model also helps with model explainability. To further increase forecast model accuracy, you can add additional information or attributes such as price, promotion, category details, holidays, or weather information, but you may not know how each attribute influences your forecast. With today’s launch, Forecast now helps you understand and explain how your forecasting model is making predictions by providing explainability reports after your model has been trained. Explainability reports include impact scores, so you can understand how each attribute in your training data contributes to either increasing or decreasing your forecasted values. By understanding how your model makes predictions, you can make more informed business decisions. Additionally, using the new <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API%5FCreateExplainability.html">CreateExplainability API</a>, Amazon Forecast now provides granular item level explainability insights across specific items and time duration of choice. Better understanding why a particular forecast value is high or low at a particular time is helpful for decision making and building trust and confidence in your ML solutions. Explainability removes the need of running multiple manual analyses to understand past sales and external variable trends to explain forecast results.</p>
<p>To get more accurate forecasts, faster retraining, and model explainability, read <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/new-amazon-forecast-api-that-creates-up-to-40-more-accurate-forecasts-and-provides-explainability/">our blog</a> or follow the steps in this <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-forecast-samples/tree/main/notebooks/basic/Getting%5FStarted">notebook</a> in our GitHub repo.

"<p>AWS IoT SiteWise now supports data ingestion using ModBus TCP and EtherNet/IP (EIP) protocols. You can do so by adding Modbus or EIP devices as data sources to your <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/choose-gateway-platform.html">SiteWise Gateway</a>. For data ingestion from OPC-UA data sources, you can now customize the scan mode and scan rate along with specifying deadbands. Lastly, you can provide a custom AWS IoT Greengrass StreamManager stream as a destination for protocol data.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modbus TCP data sources:</strong> For each Modbus TCP data source (such as a flow meter or a power meter), you can specify which Modbus registers to ingest data from along with the polling frequency (scan rate). For each tag, you can specify the Modbus TCP source data type you want to convert data from along with a AWS IoT SiteWise destination data type to convert data to. In order to add Modbus data sources, you need to ensure your edge device has the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/modbus-tcp-connector.html">AWS IoT Greengrass Modbus connector</a> deployed. Refer to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/config-modbus-console.html">this page</a> in the AWS IoT SiteWise user guide to review all supported configuration options.</li>
<li><strong>EtherNet/IP data sources:</strong> For each EtherNet/IP data source (such as a programmable logic controller), you can specify which tags (data streams) to ingest data from along with the polling frequency (scan rate). For each tag, you can specify which AWS IoT SiteWise destination data type to convert data to (source data type is automatically inferred from the protocol). In order to add EIP sources, you need to ensure your edge device has the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/ethernet-ip-connector.html">AWS IoT Greengrass EtherNet/IP connector</a> deployed. Refer to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/config-eip-console.html">this page</a> in the AWS IoT SiteWise user guide to review all supported configuration options.</li>
<li><strong>Custom scan mode and scan rate for OPC-UA data sources:</strong> For OPC-UA data sources, you can now choose between “Subscription” or “Polling” scan mode. In subscription mode, the OPC-UA server transmits data only when it changes. This mode is helpful in ingesting data from sources that have a high rate of change. In polling mode, the connector polls the OPC-UA server at a specified frequency to pull data points even if the values do not change. This is helpful in ensuring a constant rate of ingestion from sources that may have a low rate of change. For both these options, you can select a scan rate or polling frequency. For more details, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/opcua-data-acquisition.html#opcua-scanmode">refer to this section</a> in the AWS IoT SiteWise user guide.</li>
<li><strong>Deadbanding for OPC-UA data sources:</strong> For OPC-UA data sources, you can now specify deadband ranges, during which the OPC-UA server will only transmit new data if it falls outside of the specified deadband range, when compared to the last transmitted value. You can use this functionality to reduce ingestion rate as well as smoothen out a data stream by ensuring only changes beyond a certain threshold get transmitted. You can select an absolute value or percentage based dead-band range. For example, specifying a 10% deadband value on a sensor with a range 20 degree range (+40 degrees Fahrenheit to +60 degrees Fahrenheit) tells the server to only transmit data when the value changes by 2 degrees Fahrenheit or more compared to the last transmitted value. For more details, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/opcua-data-acquisition.html#opcua-deadbanding">refer to this section</a> in the AWS IoT SiteWise user guide.</li>
<li><strong>AWS IoT Greengrass StreamManager stream destination for protocol data:</strong> For all 3 protocol data sources (OPC-UA, Modbus and EIP), you can now select a custom AWS IoT Greengrass StreamManager stream as the destination for the data. Up until this point, all data would go to the “SiteWise Stream” that would then be routed to the AWS IoT SiteWise cloud service. By routing data to a custom stream, you can now author AWS Lambda functions that can perform local transformations or filtering, on the edge. For e.g. you can connect to a local on-premise ERP system to load information to enrich the data streams. You can also <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/stream-export-configurations.html">setup an export</a> on the custom stream to send data to AWS IoT Analytics, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and Amazon S3. For more details, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/source-destination.html">refer to this page</a> in the AWS IoT SiteWise user guide.</li>
</ul>
<p>AWS IoT SiteWise is a managed service that makes it easy to collect, store, organize and monitor data from industrial equipment at scale to help you make better, data-driven decisions. To get started, log into the AWS Management Console and navigate to AWS IoT SiteWise console and check out a demo to see what you can achieve with AWS IoT SiteWise.

"<p>Since our last update in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/2020-in-review-for-aws-cloudformation/">March 2021</a>, AWS CloudFormation has expanded the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry.html">CloudFormation Registry </a>to support 79 new resource types between April and July 2021 (see the complete list at the end of this post). A resource type includes schema (resource properties and handler permissions) and handlers that control API interactions with the underlying AWS or third-party services. Out of these 79, AWS has published 56 and AWS Partner Network (APN) Partners have 23. Customers can now configure, provision, and manage these newly supported resources through CloudFormation in a predictable and reliable way. Among the AWS resources, we are pleased to announce that 8 new AWS services added launch day CloudFormation support. These services include: Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS), Amazon Nimble Studio, AWS IoT Device Management, Amazon FinSpace, Amazon Fraud Detector, Amazon Location Services, AWS App Runner, and Amazon Lookout for Equipment. CloudFormation now supports <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html">775 AWS resource types across 160 AWS services</a>.   </p>
<p>Customers can now centrally discover the schema associated with these 79 new resource types on the CloudFormation Registry. With the addition of these resource types to the Registry, customers get additional benefits from other CloudFormation features such as resource import and drift detection. For example, if you create App Runner service resource through the AWS console or the Command Line Interface (CLI), you can simply import that resource into CloudFormation and leverage added benefits of CloudFormation such as easily identifying resource drift in the stack containing App Runner resource. Customers can also use AWS Config to manage the compliance for all these 79 resource types. These resource types will be automatically tracked in AWS Config as Configuration Items, if you create, update, or delete these resources using CloudFormation and if you have configured AWS Config to record all resource types.   </p>
<p>If you have feedback on the type of resources for which you want CloudFormation support, please refer to <a href="https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-coverage-roadmap">aws-cloudformation-coverage-roadmap</a>.</p>
<p>Now you can configure, provision, and manage the following 79 resource types with CloudFormation.  </p>

"<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns">Amazon Simple Notification Service</a> (Amazon SNS) is a fully-managed messaging service that supports application-to-person (A2P) workloads, including mobile text messaging (SMS). Now, when you start using Amazon SNS to send SMS, your SMS workloads start in an isolated testing environment, called the SMS sandbox. </p>
<p>To increase consumer trust in SMS, the A2P industry, across various countries, has set new policies and requirements for commercial entities to be able to send SMS to consumers. In India, the Telecom Authority of India (TRAI) introduced regulations requiring each commercial entity to register their sender ID as well as their SMS message templates. In the US, telecom carriers started requiring that each commercial entity register their SMS origination ID to send A2P SMS messages to US phone numbers. Thus, Amazon SNS announced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/04/amazon-sns-now-supports-setting-attributes-required-for-india-dlt-requirements-when-sending-sms-using-local-routes-in-india">support for TRAI requirements for sending SMS to India</a>, as well as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/02/amazon-sns-now-supports-sending-sms-messages-to-us-destinations-using-ten-digit-long-codes-and-toll-free-numbers">support for ten-digit long codes (10DLC) and toll-free numbers (TFN) for sending SMS to the US</a>.  </p>
<p>Now, we are introducing the SMS sandbox. It provides an environment for you to safely develop and test your SMS workloads in Amazon SNS. While in the SMS sandbox, you can add up to 10 destination phone numbers, and verify them via one-time passwords (OTP), using either the Amazon SNS console or SDK. You can then use Amazon SNS to send SMS to these verified destination numbers. In the SMS sandbox, before your solution is enabled for production use, you can perform development and testing activities for your SMS workloads, confirm if you need to take steps to comply with country-specific requirements, purchase and register the required SMS resources (such as an SMS origination identity), and set the SMS spend quota needed for your application. When you are ready, you can apply to move your account to production, enabling your application to send SMS to unverified destination phone numbers.   </p>
<p>You can check if you are in the SMS sandbox by checking the status of your account via the Amazon SNS console or SDK. If you are currently using Amazon SNS to send SMS messages, your account has automatically been upgraded to production status, in AWS regions where you currently operate.  </p>
<p>In addition to the SMS sandbox, the Amazon SNS console now displays the list of origination phone numbers associated with your account. When operating in multiple countries, you can now use this list to view the origination ID that you can use to send SMS via Amazon SNS to a specific country. If you have Amazon CloudWatch logs enabled, SMS delivery logs are now displayed in your Amazon SNS console, further improving your ability to troubleshoot SMS delivery failures during development.   </p>
<p>Along with these updates to Amazon SNS, we are announcing updated SMS pricing in the US and Canada. The new pricing now separates the provided SMS price into two components, namely the AWS base price and a carrier fee. This fee structure provides you more visibility into the components of per-unit price of SMS, which depends on the type of origination ID that you use to send SMS, the route the SMS takes, and other carrier network factors.</p>
<p>The following resources can help you get started:</p>

"<p>Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler reduces the time it takes to aggregate and prepare data for machine learning (ML) from weeks to minutes. With SageMaker Data Wrangler, you can simplify the process of data preparation and feature engineering, and complete each step of the data preparation workflow, including data selection, cleansing, exploration, and visualization from a single visual interface. With SageMaker Data Wrangler’s data selection tool, you can quickly select data from multiple data sources, such as Amazon S3, Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, AWS Lake Formation, Amazon SageMaker Feature Store, and Snowflake.  </p>
<p>Today we are announcing the general availability of support for JSON, JSONL, and ORC file formats in Data Wrangler. You can now browse, preview, and import your data in these file formats using Data Wrangler. The ORC file format provides a highly efficient way to store Hive data, however it can be difficult to preview this data using a text editor. With support for the ORC file format in Data Wrangler, you can now easily browse data in an ORC file just as you would a csv file. To learn more about importing ORC files and preparing JSON data with Data Wrangler, read the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/prepare-and-analyze-json-and-orc-data-with-amazon-sagemaker-data-wrangler/">blog</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are announcing the general availability of several new transforms including: transforms to handle class imbalance in your data sets, transforms to process columns with arrays and JSON-formatted strings, and a similarity encoding transform to efficiently encode categorical data with high cardinality. These transforms add to Data Wrangler’s collection of over 300 transforms, which includes many transforms for processing time series data. Below is a detailed description of these new transforms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Balance data.</strong> Datasets can frequently be imbalanced favoring one target class over the other. The new balance transform can help you oversample a sparse minority class depending on your requirements. Additionally, you can now generate new samples of the minority class using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) now generally available in Data Wrangler. SMOTE automatically generates new observations of your minority class from groups of similar rows in your data set. To learn more about how to handle imbalanced data sets with Data Wrangler, read the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/balance-your-data-for-machine-learning-with-amazon-sagemaker-data-wrangler/">blog</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Handle Structured Columns.</strong> For columns that contain arrays, a new <strong>explode array</strong> transform generates a new row for each value in the array. For JSON-formatted strings, a new <strong>flatten structured column</strong> transform creates new columns for each key-value pair in the JSON-formatted string. To learn more about handling structured columns with Data Wrangler, read the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/prepare-and-analyze-json-and-orc-data-with-amazon-sagemaker-data-wrangler/">blog</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Encode Categorical Variables.</strong> Using a new <strong><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/data-wrangler-transform.html#data-wrangler-transform-cat-encode">similarity encoding transform,</a></strong> you can now efficiently encode categorical variables with high cardinality. Many data scientists frequently apply a one-hot encoding to their categorical variables, which converts each categorical value into a separate column. The process of one-hot encoding can turn a single column with US states into 50 new binary valued variables (one for each state). With similarity encoding now available in Data Wrangler, you can encode a categorical variable into a much smaller number of columns while retaining or possibly increasing model performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we are announcing the general availability of a one-click “Create job” experience to launch data processing jobs. Starting today, you can click a “Create job” button which allows you to start a data processing job using the steps specified in your Data Wrangler flow. You can still use the data processing notebooks in Data Wrangler to launch data processing jobs and integrate Data Wrangler into your MLOps pipelines. To learn more about how to launch a data processing job with Data Wrangler, read the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/launch-processing-jobs-with-a-few-clicks-using-amazon-sagemaker-data-wrangler/">blog</a>.   </p>
<p>To get started with new capabilities of Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler, you can open Amazon SageMaker Studio after <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/data-wrangler-update.html">upgrading to the latest release</a> and click File &gt; New &gt; Flow from the menu or “new data flow” from the SageMaker Studio launcher.

"<p>You can now allow AWS CloudFormation to assume service roles which determine what CloudFormation is allowed to do with your stack. A service role is an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id%5Froles.html">role</a> which can be assigned permissions that determine which AWS resources CloudFormation can create, update, or delete. For example, you could create a service role that only allows CloudFormation to perform actions with Amazon EC2. Previously, CloudFormation would use the default permissions from the user credentials you used to access CloudFormation. Using service roles with CloudFormation, you can now more easily set granular permissions to CloudFormation for different AWS accounts or IAM users. To get started, you can set a service role when creating, updating, or deleting a stack. You will also need permission to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id%5Froles%5Fuse%5Fpassrole.html">pass the role</a> to CloudFormation.

"<p>Today we are excited to announce the general availability of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/augmented-ai">Amazon Augmented AI</a> (Amazon A2I), a new service that makes it easy to implement human reviews of machine learning (ML) predictions. Amazon A2I brings human review capabilities to all developers by removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with building and managing human review systems.   </p>
<p>Many machine learning use cases require human judgement to get high confidence predictions, or to audit predictions on an on-going basis. For example, extracting information from scanned mortgage application forms might require human review due to low-quality scans or poor handwriting. Building human review systems to do this work can be time consuming and expensive because it involves implementing complex processes or workflows, writing custom software to manage review tasks and results, and in many cases, managing a large workforce of reviewers.   </p>
<p>Amazon A2I provides built-in human review workflows for common ML use cases like content moderation (with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition">Amazon Rekognition</a>) and text extraction (with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/textract">Amazon Textract</a>). There is also an option to create human review workflows for custom ML models including those built on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker">Amazon SageMaker</a>. You can use a pool of reviewers from within your own organization, or you can access the workforce of over 500,000 independent contractors who are already performing machine learning tasks through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Alternatively, if your data requires confidentiality or special skills, there is a workforce of vendors who are experienced with review projects and pre-screened by AWS for quality and security procedures, including iVision, CapeStart Inc., Cogito, and iMerit  </p>
<p>Below are a few examples of how Amazon A2I works with Amazon Textract, Amazon Rekognition and custom models in SageMaker: </p>
<p>Amazon A2I with Amazon Textract: Amazon Textract is a service that automatically extracts text and data from scanned documents. Amazon Textract goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to also identify the contents of fields in forms and information stored in tables. This service allows you to define the conditions in which a human reviewer is needed by using the Amazon Textract form data extraction API and Amazon A2I. The conditions can be adjusted at any time to achieve the right balance between accuracy and cost-effectiveness. With this you can specify which form fields are important in the documents and send those to human review. You can also choose to send a random sample of Amazon Textract predictions to human reviewers, using those results to learn more about the model’s performance and to audit model inferences. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/using-amazon-textract-with-amazon-augmented-ai-for-processing-critical-documents/">Learn more about Amazon Textract and A2I</a>.  </p>
<p>Amazon A2I with Amazon Rekognition: Amazon Rekognition helps you identify potentially unsafe or inappropriate content across both image and video assets and provides you with detailed labels that allow you to accurately control what you want to allow based on your needs. With Amazon Rekognition, you can automate content moderation workflows by setting business rules for the prediction confidence. For sensitive or nuanced content, customers often need trained human experts to verify machine predictions that are lower confidence. With Amazon A2I, you can easily add human reviews to moderation workflows, for example, flagging all images that return a prediction confidence for explicit nudity between 50% to 80% for additional human review. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/a2i-rekognition.html">Learn more</a> about how to set up Amazon A2I with Amazon Rekognition moderation.</p>
<p>Amazon A2I with Custom ML models: Amazon A2I makes it easy to integrate human judgement and AI into any ML application, regardless of whether it's run on AWS. You can use the Amazon A2I APIs to add human reviews to any machine learning application that uses a custom ML model built with Amazon SageMaker or other solutions. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-task-types-custom.html">Learn more</a> about how to use Amazon A2I with any machine learning model.</p>
<p>Get started with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/augmented-ai/pricing">Amazon A2I for free</a> including a total of 500 human reviews (42 objects per month) in your first year.

S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval delivers the fastest access to archive storage, with the same throughput and milliseconds access as the S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA storage classes. In addition, the existing S3 Glacier storage class is renamed to be S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and now includes free bulk retrievals and a 10% storage price reduction, making it optimized for backup and disaster recovery use cases.   </p>
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier">Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes</a> are purpose-built for data archiving, and are designed to provide you with the highest performance, the most retrieval flexibility, and the lowest cost archive storage in the cloud. You can now choose from three archive storage classes optimized for different access patterns and storage duration. For archive data that needs immediate access, such as medical images, news media assets, or genomics data, choose the S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage class, an archive storage class that delivers the lowest cost storage with milliseconds retrieval. For archive data that does not require immediate access but needs the flexibility to retrieve large sets of data at no cost, such as backup or disaster recovery use cases, choose S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly S3 Glacier), with retrieval in minutes or free bulk retrievals in 5-12 hours. To save even more on long-lived archive storage such as compliance archives and digital media preservation, choose S3 Glacier Deep Archive, the lowest cost storage in the cloud with data retrieval from 12-48 hours.  </p>
<p>You can get started with S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval with a few clicks in the S3 console. You can upload data directly into S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval through the Amazon S3 API, CLI, or use S3 Lifecycle to transition data from the S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA storage classes into S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval. Like other Amazon S3 storage classes, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval supports all S3 features—including S3 Storage Lens to view storage usage and activity metrics, and S3 Replication to replicate data to any AWS Region. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9s) of data durability and 99.9% availability by redundantly storing data across multiple physically separated AWS Availability Zones.  </p>

"<p>Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor continuously monitors machine learning models for concept drift (i.e. changes in data distribution and characteristics over time) and alerts you if there are any deviations so you can take remedial action. Starting today, you can also use Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor to detect drift in model quality, bias, and feature importance. With these new fully managed capabilities, SageMaker Model Monitor helps you maintain high quality machine learning models in production.  </p>
<p>Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor currently supports detecting data quality drift by tracking the difference between data that was used to train the models versus the data that is being presented to the model to score and alerting you of deviations to help you take timely actions such as auditing data or retraining models. Today, we are adding three new capabilities to SageMaker Model Monitor, enabling you to detect drift in model quality, model bias, and feature importance.  </p>
<p>With model quality monitoring, you can monitor model characteristics (such as precision, accuracy, recall, and more) of your ML models in real time. SageMaker Model monitor reports how well a ML model is predicting outcomes by comparing model prediction to ground truth data. As the model is monitored, you can view exportable reports and graphs detailing model quality in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-studio.html">Amazon SageMaker Studio</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi.html">SageMaker Notebook instance</a>. You can also configure <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch">Amazon CloudWatch</a> to receive notifications if drift in model quality is observed.  </p>
<p>Bias monitoring helps you detect bias in your ML models on a regular basis. SageMaker Model Monitor periodically determines when bias metrics drift into levels that statistically exceed preset thresholds. With bias monitoring capabilities in Model Monitor, you can view metrics and visualize the results in SageMaker Studio. You can also configure automated alerts so that you can immediately know when your model exceeds bias metric thresholds you have set.</p>
<p>After models are deployed in production, the importance and impact of certain features in the model can change over time. Model explainablility monitoring helps you understand and interpret whether the predictions made by your ML models are based on the same features, and in the same proportion, as when your model was trained. When you enable explainability tracking, SageMaker Model Monitor automatically detects drift in relative importance of features, enables you to visualize these changes in SageMaker Studio, and, like all other SageMaker Model Monitor features, can be configured with Amazon CloudWatch to proactively alert you when drift is detected.   </p>
<p>Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor can be enabled for new or existing real-time inference endpoints. Once enabled, SageMaker Model Monitor saves prediction requests and responses in Amazon S3, compares the model predictions with actuals or ground truth you provide, runs built-in or custom rules to detect drift against a baseline, and alerts you when there are deviations. As a result, you can monitor hundreds of models for drift in data quality, model quality, model bias, and feature importance in a standardized way across your organization without having to build any additional tooling. Monitoring jobs can be scheduled to run at a regular cadence (for example hourly or daily) and push reports as well as metrics to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch">Amazon CloudWatch</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a>. The monitoring results are also available in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-studio.htm">Amazon SageMaker Studio</a> for visual inspection and you can also further analyze the results using an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi.html">Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance</a>. </p>
<p>Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor is available in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services">all commercial regions</a> where Amazon SageMaker is available. You also get up to 30 hours of monitoring aggregated across all endpoints each month, at no charge, when you use built-in monitoring rules with the default ml.m5.xlarge instance.

"<p>Amazon Rekognition content moderation is a deep learning-based service that can detect inappropriate, unwanted, or offensive images and videos, making it easier to find and remove such content at scale. Amazon Rekognition provides a detailed taxonomy of moderation categories such as 'Explicit Nudity', 'Suggestive', ‘Violence’, and 'Visually Disturbing'. Starting today, customers can detect 6 new categories - 'Drugs', ‘Tobacco’, ‘Alcohol’, ‘Gambling’, ‘Rude Gestures’, and ‘Hate Symbols’. In addition, customers also get improved detection rates for already supported categories. Using Amazon Rekognition moderation APIs, social media, broadcast media, advertising, and e-commerce customers can create a better user experience, provide brand safety assurances to advertisers, or comply with local and global regulations. </p>
<p>Today, many companies employ teams of human moderators to review third-party or user generated content, while others simply react to user complaints to take down offensive or inappropriate images, ads, or videos. However, human moderators alone cannot meet moderation needs at Internet scale. This can lead to a poor user experience, prohibitive costs to achieve required coverage, or even a loss of brand reputation. By using Amazon Rekognition for image and video moderation, human moderators only have to review a much smaller set of content flagged by machine learning, typically 1-5% of the total volume. This allows them to focus on more valuable activities, reduce the burden of viewing disturbing content, and still achieve full coverage at a fraction of the cost of a completely manual process. Moreover, Amazon Rekognition provides a hierarchical set of top-level and second-level moderation categories. Using this taxonomy, customers can create varied business rules to handle different geographic and demographic requirements. For a full list of all supported categories, please see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/moderation.html">this page</a>. </p>
<p>Let’s look at a few common use cases for Amazon Rekognition content moderation: </p>
<p>Social media and photo sharing platforms work with very large amounts of user generated photos and videos daily. To ensure that uploaded content does not violate community guidelines and societal standards, these customers can use Amazon Rekognition to flag and remove such content at scale even with small teams of human moderators. Detailed moderation labels also allow for creating more granular set of user filters. For example, a user might find images containing drinking or alcoholic beverages to be acceptable in a liquor ad, but may want to avoid ones showing drug products and drug use under any circumstances. </p>
<p>Similarly, broadcast and Video-On-Demand (VOD) media companies have to ensure that they comply with the regulations of the markets and geographies in which they operate. For example, content that shows smoking needs to carry an onscreen health advisory warning in countries like India. Further, brands and advertisers want to prevent unsuitable associations when placing their ads in a video, for example, a toy brand for children may not want their ad to appear next to content showing consumption of alcoholic beverages. Media companies can now use the comprehensive set of categories available in Amazon Rekognition to flag the portions of a movie or TV show that require further action from their editors or ad traffic teams. This saves valuable time, improves brand safety for advertisers, and helps prevent costly compliance fines from regulators. </p>
<p>Lastly, e-commerce and online classified platforms that allow third-party or user product listings want to promptly detect and delist illegal, inappropriate, or controversial products such as items displaying hate symbols, adult products, or tobacco and drug products. Amazon Rekognition’s new moderation categories helps streamline this process significantly by flagging potentially problematic listings for further review or action. </p>
<p>New content moderation categories and accuracy improvements for both Amazon Rekognition Image and Video are now available in all AWS Regions supported by Amazon Rekognition. To get started, please <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-rekognition-adds-support-for-six-new-content-moderation-categories/">read our blog</a> for more details.

"<p>Amazon Rekognition added three new features today: detection and recognition of text in images; real-time face recognition across tens of millions of faces; and detection of up to 100 faces in challenging crowded photos. Customers who are already using Amazon Rekognition for face verification and identification will experience up to a 10% accuracy improvement in most cases. </p>
<p><strong>Text in Image:</strong> Customers using Amazon Rekognition to detect objects and faces in images have been asking us to recognize text embedded in images, such as street signs and license plates captured by traffic cameras, news, and captions on TV screens, or stylized quotes overlaid on phone-captured family pictures. Starting today, you can use Rekognition Text in Image to recognize and extract textual content from images. Text in Image is specifically built to work with real-world images rather than document images. It supports text in most Latin scripts and numbers embedded in a large variety of layouts, fonts, and styles, and overlaid on background objects at various orientation as banners and posters.</p>
<p>For example, in image sharing and social media applications, you can now enable visual search based on an index of images that contain the same keywords. In media and entertainment applications, you can catalogue videos based on relevant text on screen, such as ads, news, sport scores, and captions. Additionally, in security and safety applications, you can identify vehicles based on license plate numbers from images taken by street cameras. </p>
<p>“As a visually-driven platform, Pinterest relies heavily on the speed and quality of images, but the text behind those images is just as important, as it provides context and makes Pins actionable for our 200M+ active Pinners. In working with Amazon Rekognition Text in Image, we can better extract the rich text captured in images at scale and with low latency for the millions of Pins stored in Amazon S3. We look forward to continuing to develop the partnership with AWS for high quality and fast experiences for Pinners and businesses on Pinterest.” - Vanja Josifovski, CTO, Pinterest</p>
<p>“Professional photographers often use SmugMug to share and sell photos containing text, for example, the numbers on marathon race bibs. Amazon Rekognition Text in Image allows us to programmatically extract bib numbers at scale and provide event photographers with even more functionality to quickly and easily share and monetize photos from these events. " - Don MacAskill, Co-founder, CEO &amp; Chief Geek at SmugMug  </p>
<p><strong>Face Search and Detection:</strong> With Amazon Rekognition, you can now perform real-time face searches against collections with tens of millions of faces. This represents a 5-10X reduction in search latency, while simultaneously allowing for collections that can store 10-20X more faces than before.</p>
<p>In security and safety applications, you can now identify people of interest against a collection of millions of faces in near real-time, enabling use cases such as timely and accurate crime prevention. The Washington County Sheriff’s Office is the primary first responder for 911 calls from the citizens in Oregon. The office also provides support for crime prevention to other city police departments countywide. The Sheriff’s Office had previously used Amazon Rekognition to reduce the identification time of suspects from 2-3 days down to minutes.</p>
<p>“These improvements allow deputies in the field to receive the response to searches in near real time. This allows them to get the information they need and take action quickly. Seconds saved in the field can make the difference in saving a life.” Chris Adzima, Senior Information Systems Analyst for the Washington County Sheriff’s Office.</p>
<p>Starting today, customers can also detect, analyze and index up to 100 faces (up from 15) in a single image. With this improvement, you can accurately capture demographics and analyze sentiments for all faces in group photos, crowded events and public locations such as airports and department stores.   </p>
<p>To get started with Text in Image, Face Search and Face Detection, download the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/developers">latest SDK</a> or simply log in to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/">Amazon Rekognition Console</a> to try out this feature with the supplied sample images, or your own images.

"<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation">AWS CloudFormation</a> announces the launch of the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry.html">CloudFormation Public Registry</a>, a new searchable collection of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry.html">extensions</a> that allows you to discover, provision, and manage third-party extensions, which include resource types (provisioning logic) and modules published by AWS Partner Network (APN) Partners and the developer community. You can also create and publish your own extensions on the CloudFormation Public Registry, allowing anyone to use them. Today, you can centrally search and use over 35 extensions published on the Public Registry by APN Partners and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart">AWS Quick Starts</a>. You can view the identity verification for each extension publisher on the Public Registry. APN Partners who collaborated on this launch include MongoDB, Datadog, Atlassian Opsgenie, JFrog, Trend Micro, Splunk, Aqua Security, FireEye, Sysdig, Snyk, Check Point, Spot by NetApp, Gremlin, Stackery, and Iridium.</p>
<p>With this launch, anyone can now publish their resource types on the Public Registry. AWS CloudFormation and AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) customers can discover the published third-party resource types, eliminating the need to build and maintain these resources type themselves. You no longer have to maintain a separate custom resource to provision or manage this capability. With third-party resource types included in the Public Registry, you can use CloudFormation features such as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/detect-drift-stack.html">drift detection</a>. Drift detection allows you to identify resource drift in your stack from its expected template configuration and understand detailed information about the drift status for each third-party resource type. You can also use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/config">AWS Config</a> to manage the compliance of third-party resource types. Resource types from the CloudFormation Registry will be automatically tracked in AWS Config as Configuration Items, if you create, update, or delete these resources using CloudFormation and if you have configured AWS Config to record all resource types. Whether they are third-party or AWS resources, you can now view configuration history for Registry resource types as well as write Config rules to verify configuration best practices.</p>
<p>Public Registry also supports CloudFormation <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/modules.html">modules</a>. Anyone can now publish a collection of reusable modules on the Public Registry. Customers can browse, discover, and choose from this collection of pre-built modules to provision the resources without needing to sort through detailed resource configurations.</p>
<p>Customers can also activate these third-party resource types or modules across their entire organization or specific organization units (OUs) in a single operation using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-concepts.html">CloudFormation StackSets</a> with service-managed permissions. You can use the AWS::CloudFormation::TypeActivation resource type in a template submitted to StackSets that targets the entire AWS Organization or a particular OU, and pass the ARN for the third-party public extension to activate it.</p>
<p>CloudFormation Public Registry is generally available in the following AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia, Ohio), US West (Oregon, N. California), Canada (Central), Europe (Ireland, Frankfurt, London, Stockholm, Paris, Milan), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong, Mumbai, Osaka, Singapore, Sydney, Seoul, Tokyo), South America (Sao Paulo), Middle East (Bahrain), and Africa (Cape Town).</p>
<p>There is no additional charge for using AWS CloudFormation with native AWS resource types. When you use AWS CloudFormation with third-party resource types, you will incur charges based on the number of handler operations you run per month and handler operation duration (refer to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/pricing">pricing page</a>) for more details). To learn more, refer to our user guide on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry.html">CloudFormation Public Registry</a>. </p>"

"<p>Starting today, you can proactively manage the EC2 Spot Instance lifecycle by using the new Capacity Rebalancing feature for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, EC2 Fleet, and Spot Fleet. Capacity Rebalancing helps you maintain workload availability by proactively augmenting your fleet with a new Spot Instance before a running instance receives a two-minute interruption notice. Previously, EC2 Auto Scaling, EC2 Fleet, and Spot Fleet replaced Spot Instances only after they were interrupted. Now, with Capacity Rebalancing, these services attempt to proactively replace Spot Instances when they receive the new EC2 Instance rebalance recommendation, rather than waiting until they receive a two-minute in interruption notice.  </p>
<p>The EC2 Instance rebalance recommendation is a new feature that notifies you when a Spot Instance is at elevated risk of interruption. The signal can arrive sooner than the two minute Spot Instance interruption notice, giving you the opportunity to proactively rebalance your workload to new or existing Spot Instances that are not at elevated risk of interruption. If you enable Capacity Rebalancing with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, it will attempt to launch a replacement instance when an existing Spot Instance receives the rebalance recommendation. If the replacement Spot Instance is launched before the existing instance is interrupted, EC2 Auto Scaling will proceed to terminate the existing Spot Instance. You can enable or disable Capacity Rebalancing on an existing EC2 Auto Scaling group using the CLI, SDK, or the console.  </p>
<p>Similarly, if you enable Capacity Rebalancing with EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet, they will attempt to launch a replacement instance when an existing Spot Instance receives the rebalance recommendation. You can then either manually terminate the existing Spot Instance when you’re ready (for example, after you finish any shutdown or checkpointing processes), or you can leave the instance running.  </p>
<p>Together with Capacity Rebalancing, we recommend using the capacity optimized allocation strategy and a diversified set of instance types and Availability Zones. Additionally, when using EC2 Auto Scaling, we recommend configuring EC2 Instance terminating lifecycle hooks to gracefully perform any required shutdown procedures (for example, you can start checkpointing your work early to save as much state as possible before the instance is interrupted).  </p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/capacity-rebalance.html">Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Capacity Rebalancing</a> in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/proactively-manage-spot-instance-lifecycle-using-the-new-capacity-rebalancing-feature-for-ec2-auto-scaling/">blog post</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet-configuration-strategies.html#ec2-fleet-capacity-rebalance">Capacity Rebalancing</a> for EC2 Fleet, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet.html#spot-fleet-capacity-rebalance">Capacity Rebalancing</a> for Spot Fleet.

"<p>Today, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/panorama">AWS Panorama Appliance</a> is generally available. The AWS Panorama Appliance is a new device that enables customers to improve their operations and reduce costs by using existing on-premises cameras and analyzing video streams locally with computer vision.  </p>
<p>Customers in industrial, hospitality, logistics, retail and other industries want to use computer vision to make decisions faster and optimize their operations. For example, these organizations often need to perform physical inspections of production lines to spot defects in manufacturing products, monitor drive-through queues at quick-service restaurants to enhance customer experience, or optimize the layout of their physical locations by improving product placement. These customers typically have cameras installed onsite to support their businesses, but they often resort to manual processes like watching video feeds in real time to extract value from their network of cameras, which is tedious, expensive, and difficult to scale. While some smart cameras can provide real-time visual inspection, replacing existing cameras with new smart cameras can be cost prohibitive. Even then, smart cameras are often ineffective because they are limited to specific use cases and require additional effort to fine-tune. For example, updating a smart camera due to a simple change in the environment (e.g. lighting, camera placement, or production line speed) means that a customer often has to contact their vendor for support which can be costly and time-consuming. Alternatively, some customers send video feeds from existing on-premises cameras to third party servers, but often the required internet bandwidth is costly or facilities are in remote locations where internet connectivity can be slow, all of which degrades the usefulness and practicality of the analysis. Consequently, most customers are stuck using slow, expensive, error-prone, or manual processes for visual monitoring and inspection tasks that do not scale and can lead to missed defects or operational inefficiencies.  </p>
<p>The AWS Panorama Appliance helps customers to solve these challenges by enabling them to improve operations and reduce costs by using existing on-premises cameras and analyzing video streams locally with computer vision. Customers can get started in minutes by connecting the AWS Panorama Appliance to their network and identifying the video feeds for analysis. Because the computer vision processing happens locally on the AWS Panorama Appliance at the edge, customers can save on bandwidth costs and use it in locations with limited internet bandwidth. Additionally, the AWS Panorama Appliance is integrated with Amazon SageMaker (an AWS service that makes it easy for data scientists and developers to build, train, and deploy machine learning models), so customers can update their computer vision application in Amazon SageMaker and deploy the model to the AWS Panorama Appliance themselves. </p>
<p>For customers that do not want to build their own computer vision applications, AWS Panorama Partners like Deloitte, TaskWatch, Vistry, Sony, and Accenture provide a wide range of solutions that can address unique use cases across manufacturing, construction, hospitality, retail, and other industries. For example, customers in the retail industry have used AWS Panorama Partners to develop computer vision applications that can analyze foot traffic to help optimize store layout and product placement, analyze peak times when additional staffing is needed to assist customers, and quantify inventory levels.  </p>
<p>Customers like The Vancouver Fraser Port Authority, Tyson Foods, Inc., and The Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport are are working with AWS Panorama Partners to use AWS Panorama to improve quality control, optimize supply chain, and enhance consumer experiences at the edge.  </p>
<p>The AWS Panorama Appliance is available for sale on <a href="https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/elemental-appliances-software/home?region=us-west-2#/quotelist">AWS Elemental</a> in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and most of the European Union. The AWS Panorama service is available today in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), and Europe (Ireland), with availability in additional AWS Regions in the coming months.

"<p>The Amazon <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds">Relational Database Service</a> (RDS) was designed to simplify one of the most complex of all common IT activities: managing and scaling a relational database while providing fast, predictable performance and high availability.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon RDS in Action</strong><br />
During the last 3.5 years in operation, a lot has happened. Amazon RDS is now being used in mission-critical deployments by tens of thousands of businesses of all sizes. We now process trillions of I/O requests each month for these customers. We're seeing strong adoption in enterprises such as Samsung and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/unilever">Unilever</a>, web-scale applications like Flipboard and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/airbnb">Airbnb</a>, and large-scale organizations like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/nasa-jpl-curiosity">NASA JPL</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/obama">Obama for America</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon RDS Innovation</strong><br />
We have added support for three major database engines (MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server), expanded support to all nine of the AWS Regions, and added more than 50 highly requested features. Following is the list of a few key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple database engines: Support for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/oracle">Oracle </a>and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver">Microsoft SQL Server</a> in addition to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql">MySQL</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/multi-az">Multi-AZ deployments</a>: This feature enables you to create highly available database deployments with synchronous replication across Availability Zones, automatic failure detection, and failover using just a few clicks on the AWS Management Console.</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/#Read%5FReplica">Read Replicas</a>: This feature makes it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single database instance for read-heavy database workloads. You can <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/10/amazon-rds-for-mysql-promote-read-replica.html">promote</a> a Read Replica to a master as needed and monitor the replication status directly through the AWS Management Console.</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/#PIOPS">Provisioned IOPS</a>: Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS is a storage option designed to deliver fast, predictable, and consistent I/O performance, and is optimized for I/O-intensive, transactional (OLTP) database workloads. You can provision up to 3TB of storage and 30,000 IOPS per database instance.</li>
<li><a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/03/amazon-rds-access-to-database-log-files.html">Point-and-click access to database logs</a>: You can view and download a variety of database log files to troubleshoot database issues directly using the AWS Management Console.</li>
<li><a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/02/relational-database-service-now-with-event-subscriptions.html">DB Notifications via e-mail and SMS</a>: You can subscribe to receive e-mail or SMS notifications when certain database events such as failover, low storage, replication state change etc. occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>These innovations are powering some of the world’s most popular applications that are used by millions of users.</p>
<p><strong>General Availability and Amazon RDS SLA</strong><br />
We’re officially calling Amazon RDS “Generally Available” after adding several important features as noted above. With the strong level of customer adoption, numerous new features and plenty of operational experience behind us, we also have a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for Amazon RDS, with 99.95% availability for Multi-AZ database instances on a monthly basis. This SLA is available for Amazon RDS for MySQL and Oracle, which are currently the database engines with Multi-AZ deployment support. If availability falls below 99.95% for your Multi-AZ database instance (which is a maximum of 22 minutes of unavailability for a Multi-AZ database instance per month), you will be eligible to receive service credits. The new Amazon RDS SLA is designed to give you additional confidence to run the most demanding and mission critical workloads dependably in the AWS cloud. You can learn more by visiting the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds-sla">Amazon RDS SLA page</a>.</p>"

"<p>AWS Launch Wizard now allows customers to deploy SAP workloads using Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 8.1. </p>
<p>AWS Launch Wizard offers a guided way of sizing, configuring, and deploying AWS resources for SAP HANA and SAP HANA-based Netweaver systems with a purpose built, easy to use wizard. </p>
<p>On-boarding a new operating system version for an SAP application involves close collaboration between SAP and Operating System (OS) teams, who analyze SAP notes, configure the system, and test extensively before standardizing on the new OS. AWS Launch Wizard eliminates this heavy lifting. You select the OS you want to use from a dropdown menu, and it automatically creates a pre-configured environment aligned with AWS and SAP best practices. </p>
<p>Configuring RHEL 8.1 for SAP workloads manually requires several additional steps compared to RHEL 7, including installation of basic OS packages, C-shell, and SAP HANA High Availability cluster configuration commands. With AWS Launch Wizard, these tasks are automated, simplifying configuration and reducing time to deployment.  </p>
<p>The following table shows the operating systems currently supported for different SAP components by AWS Launch Wizard:   </p>
<p>AWS Launch Wizard supports multiple deployment patterns, provides AWS resource recommendations, and is integrated with AWS compute, storage, management, logging, monitoring, and security services. It frees up employee/partner resources from undifferentiated infrastructure build activities so they can focus on differentiating business process design and implementation activities. </p>

"<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions">AWS Step Functions</a> now integrates with the AWS SDK, expanding the number of supported AWS Services from 17 to over 200 and AWS API Actions from 46 to over 9,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions">AWS Step Functions</a> is a low-code, visual workflow service that developers use to build distributed applications, automate IT and business processes, and build data and machine learning pipelines using AWS services. Developers define workflows visually using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/workflow-studio.html">Workflow Studio</a>, in their programming language of choice using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-stepfunctions-readme.html">CDK</a>, or in Python using the <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-step-functions-data-science-sdk-python">AWS Step Functions Data Science SDK</a>. These workflows use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-service-integrations.html">Step Functions Service Integrations</a> to compose code (running in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda">AWS Lambda</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs">Amazon ECS</a>) or AWS Resources (including DynamoDB Tables, AWS Glue Jobs, and AWS EventBridge event buses) into components of modern applications.</p>
<p>Now, with the AWS SDK integration, it’s even simpler to build on AWS. SaaS developers can take data stored in Amazon S3, augment it with information stored in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, then process with AWS machine learning services such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/textract">Amazon Textract</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend">Amazon Comprehend</a> to add new capabilities for their users. Security operations engineers can build reliable, observable, and auditable workflows that react to events from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge">Amazon EventBridge</a> then execute actions in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2">Amazon EC2</a> to enforce IT controls. Mobile application developers can build a synchronous API that uses <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/personalize">Amazon Personalize</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/location">Amazon Location Service</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint">Amazon Pinpoint</a> to enrich the experience of their users. These solutions can be faster to build, easier to scale, and cheaper to maintain because Step Functions manages the complexity, so developers can focus on business logic. And developers gain this advantage with the full selection of AWS Services.</p>
<p>The AWS SDK integration is generally available in the following regions: US East (Ohio and N. Virginia), US West (Oregon and N. California), Canada (Central), EU (Ireland and Frankfurt), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo). It will be generally available in all other commercial regions where Step Functions is available in the coming days. For a complete list of regions and service offerings, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services">AWS Regions</a>.   </p>

"<p>Today, AWS announced the launch of Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall, a managed firewall that enables customers to block DNS queries made for known malicious domains and to allow queries for trusted domains. DNS Firewall provides more granular control over the DNS querying behavior of resources within your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). </p>
<p>Route 53 Resolver is a DNS server (sometimes referred to as “AmazonProvidedDNS” or the “.2 resolver”) that is available by default in all Amazon VPCs. Route 53 Resolver responds to DNS queries from AWS resources within a VPC for public DNS records, VPC-specific domain names, and Route 53 private hosted zones. Customers have asked for finer control over the DNS queries that resources within their VPCs are allowed to make. These customers may be concerned about DNS exfiltration (where malicious actors use DNS queries to smuggle sensitive data out of networks) or may simply want to exert more control over sites that users within their organization are allowed to access.</p>
<p>Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall lets you create “blocklists” for domains you don’t want your VPC resources to communicate with via DNS. You can also take a stricter, “walled-garden” approach by creating “allowlists” that permit outbound DNS queries only to domains you specify. You can also create alerts for when outbound DNS queries match certain firewall rules, allowing you to test your rules before deploying for production traffic. Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall offers two managed domain lists—malware domains and botnet command and control domains—enabling you to get started quickly with managed protections against common threats.  </p>
<p>If you use AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts, you can use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/firewall-manager">AWS Firewall Manager</a> to deploy Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rules across multiple accounts and VPCs from a single administrator account. Firewall Manager provides security administrators a single place to centrally configure and manage different sets of firewall rules for their organizations, and automatically detects any new accounts and resources to bring them into compliance with the organization’s set of security rules. With Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall, customers can centrally deploy DNS firewall rules across accounts, organizational units (OUs), and VPCs in their organization. Alternately, customers can also choose to directly share their firewall rules across their accounts by using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ram">AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)</a>. AWS Resource Access Manager enables customers to centrally share AWS resources from various AWS services with other AWS accounts. They can utilize <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/working%5Fwith%5Fmetrics.html">Amazon CloudWatch Metrics</a> to understand the number of DNS queries being blocked or allowed by their firewall, down to the rule level. They can also enable logging by using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver-query-logs.html">Route 53 Resolver Query Logs</a> to get instance-level information on blocked and allowed queries for each VPC resource. If you choose to store your logs in CloudWatch log groups, you can use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContributorInsights.html">CloudWatch Contributor Insights</a> to create rules to generate high cardinality data, such as the top resources making the most queries which are getting blocked by the firewall.</p>
<p>Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall is now available in US East (N. Virginia), EU (Ireland), Asia Pacific (Mumbai) and US West (Oregon) with all other AWS commercial regions and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions rolling out over the next few days. To get started with this feature, visit the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver-dns-firewall.html">Route 53 documentation</a> and Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall announcement in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/how-to-get-started-with-amazon-route-53-resolver-dns-firewall-for-amazon-vpc/">AWS News blog</a>.

Teams can build custom mobile &amp; web apps that connect to their existing tools and data, enabling end-to-end solutions that solve the specific business productivity needs of teams. The connections between Honeycode and other tools are facilitated by Zapier or Amazon AppFlow, which are integration services that you can use with Honeycode. You can also use new Honeycode APIs to integrate with custom or internal tools that aren’t supported by either Zapier or AppFlow. </p>
<p>For example, a sales team could use Honeycode with Zapier to build an app for processing sales inquiries from prospective customers. Instead of dealing with emails and spreadsheets, the team could use a single Honeycode app that allows sales representatives to process inquiries from the company website. Sales managers could approve quote proposals within the app, and the app could generate a quote document and email it to the prospect. This end-to-end solution could be built with Wix (website hosting service), Honeycode (custom app used by the team), PandaDoc (quote generation service), and Zapier (integrates Honeycode with other services), however you can integrate Honeycode with thousands of other services through Zapier. The same sales team could also use AppFlow to synchronize data between Salesforce and Honeycode. </p>
<p>Honeycode customers can choose from Zapier or AppFlow to build end-to-end solutions that leverage Honeycode and their existing tools. With Zapier, customers can move data between Honeycode workbooks and thousands of other apps and services such as Salesforce, Slack, Jira, Trello, and more. Customers can schedule these connector workflows or trigger them on events in Honeycode or other apps and services. Zapier is free to use, however a paid Zapier account is required to move data from Honeycode into SaaS applications using Honeycode’s new webhook feature.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/appflow">Amazon AppFlow</a> is a fully managed integration service that enables customers to securely transfer data between AWS services and SaaS applications in just a few clicks. With AppFlow, customers can create a one-way flow from one of 15 SaaS applications (such as Salesforce, Marketo, Zendesk, etc.) or supported AWS services into Amazon Honeycode workbooks. There are no upfront charges or fees to use AppFlow, and customers pay for the number of flows they run and the volume of data processed.</p>
<p>The use of integrations via Zapier, AppFlow, and Honeycode APIs is available on all Honeycode plans at no additional cost, however you are responsible for any costs associated with using Zapier or Amazon AppFlow. You must have a Zapier account to use Zapier or an AWS account to use AppFlow. </p>

"<p>You can now run OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards version 1.2 on Amazon OpenSearch Service. This version includes a new observability interface in OpenSearch Dashboards, improvements to several other features such as anomaly detection, k-NN, and SQL/PPL. </p>
<p>Amazon OpenSearch Service lets you run and scale OpenSearch and open-source Elasticsearch (up to version 7.10) clusters with ease. <a href="https://opensearch.org/">OpenSearch</a> is a community-driven, open source search and analytics suite, originally derived from Apache 2.0 licensed Elasticsearch 7.10.2 &amp; Kibana 7.10.2. It consists of a search engine, OpenSearch, and visualization capabilities powered by OpenSearch Dashboards.</p>
<p>We launched support for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/09/amazon-elasticsearch-service-amazon-opensearch-service-opensearch-1-0">OpenSearch 1.0</a> on Amazon OpenSearch Service in September 2021, and for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/01/amazon-opensearch-supports-version-1-1">OpenSearch 1.1</a> in January 2022. The support included features such as transforms, data streams, notebooks, cross-cluster replication, and improvements to anomaly detection and alerting. We are now adding support for OpenSearch 1.2 with the following new features: </p>
<ul>
<li>New observability interface: The new observability capabilities allows developers and devops engineers to more easily analyze trace data and log data in a single interface. A <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/using-pipes-to-explore-discover-and-find-data-in-amazon-opensearch-service-with-piped-processing-language/">Piped Processing Language (PPL) based</a> event explorer helps developers interactively explore log data and visualize the results in simple to configure charts. Developers can save their PPL-based visualization and view multiple saved visualizations on a custom operational panel. Also integrated into the new observability interface is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/09/opensearch-dashboards-notebooks-amazon-opensearch-service">OpenSearch Notebooks</a>. With notebooks, developers can interactively and collaboratively develop rich reports that combine markdown, SQL/PPL queries, and visualizations with support for multi-timelines and live data so that users can easily tell a story. For more information about this feature, please see the <a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/observability-plugin/index/">documentation</a>.</li>
<li>Feature Attribution in Anomaly Detection: You can now provide an attribution ratio for each input feature to help you understand how they contributed to an anomaly. With this data, you can quickly identify the cause of the anomaly. For more information, please see documentation <a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/monitoring-plugins/ad/result-mapping/">here</a>.</li>
<li>More efficient k-NN dense vectors: k-NN now has support for <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss">Faiss</a> library, allowing you to expand the size of feature vectors. The Faiss library brings efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors and allows for search in data sets of vectors in sizes larger than what fits in memory. For more information, please see documentation <a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/1.2/search-plugins/knn/index/">here</a>.</li>
<li>‘Match’ query support in SQL and PPL: The match query type returns documents that match a provided text, number, date, or Boolean value for a specified field. The Match search query type is now supported in both SQL and PPL query languages. For more information, please see documentation <a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/1.2/observability-plugin/ppl/commands/#match">here</a> for PPL and <a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/1.2/search-plugins/sql/sql-full-text/#match">here</a> for SQL.</li>

"<p>We’re excited to announce that you can now measure the accuracy of forecasts for individual items in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/forecast">Amazon Forecast</a>, allowing you to better understand your forecasting model's performance for the items that most impact your business. Improving forecast accuracy for specific items—such as those with higher prices or higher costs—is often more important than optimizing for all items. With this launch, you can now view accuracy for individual items and export forecasts generated during training. This information allows you to better interpret results by easily comparing performance against observed historical demand, aggregating accuracy metrics across custom sets of SKUs or time periods, or visualizing results without needing to hold out a separate validation dataset. From there, you can tailor your experiments to further optimize accuracy for items significant for your needs. </p>
<p>For retailers specifically, not all SKUs are treated equally. Usually 80% of revenue is driven by 20% of SKUs, and retailers look to optimize forecasting accuracy for those top 20% SKUs. Although you can create a separate forecasting model for the top 20% SKUs, the model’s ability to learn from relevant items outside of the top 20% is limited and accuracy may suffer. Further, retailers may prefer to over-stock certain SKUs or under-stock others, and would prefer to train one model but assess forecasting accuracy for different SKUs at different stocking levels. </p>
<p>To evaluate forecasting accuracy at an item level or department level, you usually hold a validation dataset outside of Forecast and feed your training dataset to Forecast to create an optimized model. After the model is trained, you can generate multiple forecasts and compare those to the validation dataset, incurring costs during this experimentation phase, and reducing the amount of data that Forecast has to learn from. </p>
<p>With today’s launch, you can now access the forecasted values from Forecast’s internal testing of splitting the data into training and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/metrics.html">backtest</a> data groups to compare forecasts versus observed data and item-level accuracy metrics. This eliminates the need to maintain a holdout test dataset outside of Forecast. During the step of training a model, Forecast automatically splits the historical demand datasets into a training and backtesting dataset group. Forecast trains a model on the training dataset and forecasts at different specified stocking levels for the backtesting period, comparing to the observed values in the backtesting dataset group. Now, you can export the forecasts from the backtesting for each item and the accuracy metrics for each item. </p>
<p>To evaluate the strength of your forecasting model for specific items or a custom set of items based on category, you can calculate the accuracy metrics by aggregating the backtest forecast results for those items. If you have selected different stocking levels, then you can choose to assess the accuracy of items at certain stocking levels, while also measuring accuracy of other items at different stocking levels. Lastly, now you can easily visualize the forecasts compared to your historical demand by exporting the backtest forecasts to Amazon QuickSight or any other visualization tool of your preference. </p>
<p>To get started with this capability, read our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-forecast-now-supports-accuracy-measurements-for-individual-items/">blog</a> to understand how to export the backtest results for each item and see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API%5FCreatePredictorBacktestExportJob.html">CreatePredictorBacktestExportJob API</a>. We also have a <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-forecast-samples/tree/master/notebooks/advanced/Item%5FLevel%5FAccuracy">notebook</a> in our GitHub repo that walks you through how to use the Forecast APIs to export accuracy measurements of each item and calculate accuracy metrics for a custom set of items.</p>
<p>You can use this capability in all Regions where Forecast is publicly available. For more information about Region availability, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services">Region Table</a>. </p>"

"<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker">Amazon SageMaker</a> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deploy-model.html">Inference</a> now supports new model deployment options to update your machine learning models in production. Using the new <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deployment-guardrails.html">deployment guardrails</a>, you can easily switch from the current model in production to a new one in a controlled way. This launch introduces <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deployment-guardrails-blue-green-canary.html">canary</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deployment-guardrails-blue-green-linear.html">linear</a> traffic shifting modes so that you can have granular control over the shifting of traffic from your current model to the new one during the course of the update. With built-in safeguards such as auto-rollbacks, you can catch issues early and automatically take corrective action before they cause significant production impact.  </p>
<p>Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that helps developers and data scientists to prepare, build, train, and deploy high-quality machine learning models quickly by bringing together a broad set of capabilities purpose-built for ML. When you deploy your trained ML models to Amazon SageMaker, it takes care of provisioning, patching, and updating the endpoints so that you can focus on powering your applications with ML. When you need to update your endpoint with a newer version of your ML model or serving container, SageMaker brings up a new fleet (green fleet) containing the updates and shifts traffic from the existing fleet (blue fleet) in one shot, referred to as a blue/green deployment. This makes sure that the endpoint is able to respond to requests even when the update is in progress, maximizing availability.  </p>
<p>With this launch, Amazon SageMaker adds canary and linear traffic shifting modes to blue/green deployments. These modes provide you more granular control in shifting traffic between the fleets so that you can build confidence before dialing up traffic. Additionally, you can <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deployment-guardrails-configuration.html">pre-specify CloudWatch alarms on metrics</a> such as latency or error rates and automatically rollback the deployment to the blue fleet if any of these alarms are tripped. Canary mode allows you to shift a small percentage of traffic to the green fleet (called a canary fleet), observe the behavior of the canary fleet for a period of time (known as the baking period), and shift the remainder of the traffic only when no alarms are triggered during the baking period. Linear mode allows you shift traffic to the green fleet in configurable fixed increments (say 10%), and observe the behavior for a baking period before shifting the subsequent increment. With all the blue/green deployments, you can observe the fleets after all traffic has been shifted (known as the final baking period) before terminating the blue fleet. These traffic shifting modes help you balance the trade-off between managing the risk of introducing new models into production and controlling the duration of the update, so you can pick the right option for your use case. All at once traffic shifting minimizes the duration of the update and linear mode minimizes the risk of introducing a new model into production by shifting traffic in multiple steps. Canary mode shifts all the traffic in two steps, providing a balance between risk and update duration.  </p>
<p>For detailed information on these new capabilities, please read our <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deployment-guardrails.html">documentation</a>, which also contains sample notebooks to help you get started. These new phased deployment capabilities are available for all newly created endpoints in all commercial regions where Amazon SageMaker is available.

"<p>Federated queries in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/athena">Amazon Athena</a> enable users to run SQL queries across data stored in relational, non-relational, object, and custom data sources. The feature, which is now generally available in the us-east-1, us-west-2, and us-east-2 regions, enables customers to submit a single SQL query that scans data from multiple sources running on-premises or hosted in the cloud. </p>
<p>Running analytics on data spread across applications can be complex and time consuming. Data required for analytics is often spread across relational, key-value, document, in-memory, search, graph, object, time-series and ledger data stores. To analyze data across these sources, analysts build complex pipelines to extract, transform and load data into a warehouse so that the data can be queried. Accessing data from various sources requires learning new programming languages and data access constructs. Federated SQL queries in Athena eliminate this complexity by allowing users to query the data in-place from wherever it resides. Analysts can use familiar SQL constructs to JOIN data across multiple data sources for quick analysis and store results in Amazon S3 for subsequent use. </p>
<p>Athena executes federated queries using Athena Data Source Connectors that run on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda">AWS Lambda</a>. AWS has open sourced Data Source connectors for <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:292517598671:applications/AthenaDynamoDBConnector">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:292517598671:applications/AthenaHBaseConnector">Apache HBase</a>, <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:292517598671:applications/AthenaDocumentDBConnector">Amazon Document DB</a>, <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:292517598671:applications/AthenaJdbcConnector">Amazon Redshift</a>, <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:292517598671:applications/AthenaCloudwatchConnector">AWS CloudWatch</a>, <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:292517598671:applications/AthenaCloudwatchMetricsConnector">AWS CloudWatch Metrics</a>, and JDBC-compliant relational databases such as <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:292517598671:applications/AthenaJdbcConnector">MySQL</a> and <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:292517598671:applications/AthenaJdbcConnector">PostgreSQL</a> under the Apache 2.0 license. Customers can use these connectors to run federated SQL queries in Athena across these data sources. Additionally, using <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/releases">Athena Query Federation SDK</a>, developers can build connectors to any data source to enable Athena to run SQL queries against that data source. Athena Query Federation Connector extends the benefits of federated querying beyond AWS provided connectors. Since connectors run on AWS Lambda, customers do not have to manage infrastructure or plan for scaling to peak demands.</p>
<p>With this release, Athena federated query is generally available in the us-east-1, us-west-2, and us-east-2 regions. </p>
<p>To learn more about the feature, please see the documentation <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-to-a-data-source.html">here</a>.<br />

"<p>Effective December 1, 2021, AWS is making two pricing changes for data transfer out to the internet. Each month, the first terabyte of data transfer out of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront">Amazon Cloudfront</a>, the first 10 million HTTP/S requests, and the first 2 million CloudFront Functions invocations will be free. Free data transfer out of CloudFront is no longer limited to the first 12 months. In addition, the first 100 gigabytes per month of data transfer out from all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions%5Faz">AWS Regions</a> (except China and GovCoud) will be free. Free data transfer out from AWS Regions is also no longer limited to the first 12 months. These changes will replace the existing data transfer and CloudFront <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free">AWS Free Tier</a> offerings, and AWS customers will see these changes automatically reflected in their AWS bills going forward. All AWS customers will benefit from these pricing changes, and millions of customers will see no data transfer charges as a result.  </p>
<p>Today, the majority of data transfer out to the internet is from customers that are hosting live video, websites, mobile applications, and APIs on AWS. Most of this traffic is served using Amazon CloudFront, AWS’s content delivery network, which securely delivers content with low latency and high availability. CloudFront is built on the AWS global network, which is the largest network in the world, with hundreds of thousands of miles of network backbone, interconnecting 300+ Points of Presences, 81 Availability Zones, and 25 Regions. Every data center, Availability Zone, and AWS Region is interconnected via a purpose-built, highly available, and low-latency private global network infrastructure. Designed for the most demanding workloads, the AWS network is built with a fully redundant 100 GbE fiber network backbone and hundreds of terabits of capacity. This enables AWS customers to benefit from a high-performance, reliable, flexible, scalable, and secure network—while reducing costs.</p>
<p>The CloudFront free tier is a full-service free tier, meaning customers can use all CloudFront features, such as support of website images, media workloads, and APIs, without service restrictions or data type limitations. Customers will also continue to benefit from free origin fetches from their AWS origins that are hosted on AWS Regional services to CloudFront. Compared to the current CloudFront free tier, which provides 50GB per month of free data transfer out for first 12 months, this new free tier offers 20 times the amount of free data transfer out per month and does not expire after 12 months.</p>
<p>Customers with use cases that transfer data directly out of AWS Regions instead of using CloudFront, such as game streaming or live text and audio communication, will benefit from an expanded offering for free data transfer out to the internet. With this price reduction, the first 100GB per month of data transferred out of an AWS Region will be free. Now, for millions of AWS customers, the portion of their AWS bill for data transfer out to the internet will be $0. The new perpetual free tier replaces the current free tier, which offers up to 1GB per month of data transfer to the internet.</p>
<p>In addition to the millions of customers who will benefit from free CloudFront and AWS data transfer, customers with greater than 1TB of CloudFront data transfer or greater than 100GB of AWS data transfer out to the internet will also see a meaningful reduction in their AWS bills. For instance, with the new expanded free tier, a CloudFront customer with data transfer usage of 2TB and 20 million HTTP requests monthly will see a 50% reduction in their monthly bill for Amazon CloudFront, while a customer who doesn’t use CloudFront but sends 400 GB per month directly out from AWS services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Elastic Load balancing will see a 25% cost reduction. These price reductions cannot be combined with any other discount.</p>
<p>To learn more about the new price reductions going into effect, refer to the AWS News Blog, or get started now at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free">https://aws.amazon.com/free/</a>.</p>"

"<p>Starting today, you can use three new capabilities with Lambda@Edge that can further help you build personalized content for your viewers while improving latency and simplifying your origin infrastructure. First, with content-based dynamic origin selection, you can route requests to different backend origin servers based on request attributes such as viewer location, viewer device type, HTTP headers, URL path, query string or cookies. Second, you can make remote network calls from Amazon CloudFront viewer-facing events. Third, you can generate binary data from your Lambda@Edge functions which lets you deliver richer, more customized content using Amazon CloudFront. We have also increased the limits for Lambda@Edge functions. You can choose up to 1536MB of memory, deploy larger packages up to 50MB, and implement Lambda@Edge functions with longer timeouts – up to 30 seconds. </p>
<p><strong>Content-based dynamic origin selection:</strong> Previously with Lambda@Edge, you could only forward requests to a pre-defined origin that you configured for your CloudFront distribution. Now you can front multiple backend origin application services with Amazon CloudFront and use Lambda@Edge to route requests to the appropriate origin dynamically, based on the attributes of the request. For example, you could have multiple microservices based backend origins that your Lambda@Edge functions can dynamically route to by inspecting request attributes like query strings, headers or cookies. Or you can route your viewers to the most optimal origin for latency or data locality if you happen to run geographically distributed applications in different AWS regions. Content-based dynamic origin selection also lets you simplify your origin infrastructure by moving request routing logic from a fleet of reverse proxy servers that you would have had to manage to serverless Lambda@Edge functions.  </p>
<p><strong>Network calls on viewer-facing events:</strong> In addition to the remote network calls from origin-facing CloudFront events, Lambda@Edge now supports remote network calls from viewer-facing CloudFront events. For instance, you can now make remote calls to your authentication servers to verify user-privilege levels and serve premium vs. non-premium content based on what each user is authorized for.  </p>
<p><strong>Advanced response generation:</strong> Now with support for binary responses (such as images) and higher Lambda function limits, you can move more complex logic to the edge than was possible previously. For example, with remote calls and binary response generation, you can now call services like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition">Amazon Rekognition</a> to find interesting portions of images and resize, crop or compress them, add image watermarking or manipulate the images for optimal viewing experience on various viewer devices. As a content publisher, you can dynamically assemble content for each viewer from multiple external sources, run compute-intensive logic, and generate customized responses. Lambda@Edge makes all of this possible at low latencies for your viewers, and without the need to provision or manage your own servers.</p>
<p>There are no additional charges for using these new features. To learn more about Lambda@Edge, visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge">product page</a>. For more information on how to use these capabilities, please see the resources below: </p>

"<p>Amazon Comprehend, a natural-language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to uncover information in text, now allows you to extract custom entities from documents in a variety of formats (PDF, Word, plain text) and layouts (e.g., bullets, lists). This enables you to more easily extract insights and further automate your document processing workflows.</p>
<p>Prior to this announcement, you could only use Amazon Comprehend on plain text documents, which required you to flatten documents into machine-readable text, often reducing the quality of the context within the document. This new feature combines the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract custom entities from your PDF, Word, and plain text documents using the same API with no preprocessing required.</p>
<p>The new custom entity recognition feature utilizes the structural context of text (text placement within a page) combined with natural language context to extract custom entities from dense text, numbered lists, and bullets. This combination also allows customers to extract discontiguous or disconnected entities that aren’t immediately part of the same span of text (for example, entities nested within a table). This new feature also removes the need for customers to build custom logic to convert PDF and Word files to flattened, plain text before using Comprehend. By natively supporting new document formats, Comprehend offers key benefits to customers in industries such as mortgage, finance, and insurance companies, who process diverse document formats and layouts. For example, mortgage companies can now process applications faster by extracting an applicant’s bank information, address, and co-signor name from documents such as scanned PDFs of bank statements, pay stubs, and employment verification letters.  </p>
<p>To train a custom entity recognition model that can be used on your PDF, Word, and plain text documents, customers need to first annotate PDF documents using a custom <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/groundtruth">Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth</a> annotation template that is provided by Amazon Comprehend. The custom entity recognition model leverages both the natural language and positional information (e.g. coordinates) of the text to accurately extract custom entities that previously may be impacted when flattening a document. For step-by-step details on how to annotate your documents, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/custom-document-annotation-for-extracting-named-entities-in-documents-using-amazon-comprehend/">Custom document annotation for extracting named entities in documents using Amazon Comprehend</a>. Once you’ve finished annotating, you can train a custom entity recognition model and use it to extract custom entities from PDF and Word for batch (asynchronous) processing. To extract text and spatial locations of text from scanned PDF documents, Amazon Comprehend calls Amazon Textract on your behalf as a step before custom entity recognition. For details on how to train and use your model, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/extract-custom-entities-from-documents-in-their-native-format-with-amazon-comprehend/">Extract custom entities from documents in their native format with Amazon Comprehend</a>.  </p>

Customers can also benefit from enhanced log monitoring support with live tailing of logs, the ability to see surrounding log data, and the ability to do powerful ad-hoc analysis of unformatted log data at query time. </p>
<p>Currently, developers managing observability data from multiple applications have no insights into their application context. They have to analyze logs and traces in separate interfaces, and use filters to limit scope to their application of interest, making it more difficult to correlate log and trace data. With the new application analytics interface, customers can now bring together logs, metrics and trace data under a configurable application context that simplifies the correlation and analysis of these data points. Customers can also set up multiple application views and visualize the relevant logs and traces in one place. Application views also make it easy to correlate logs and traces with new <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/api/">OpenTelemetry TraceID</a> correlation capabilities. Users can set thresholds for application availability, receive alerts and drill into the details of application behavior across traces and logs. Please see the <a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/1.3/observability-plugin/app-analytics/">documentation</a> for more information on application analytics.</p>
<p>Today, developers interested in going beyond log analysis to log monitoring must use external tools for log tailing and log surround. Log tailing allows users to see a continuously updated stream of log data without having to manually refresh their view. Log surround means users no longer have to manually determine which events are connected because contextual information is accessible with a single click. This release supports log tailing and log surround features to help users cut down on root cause analysis (RCA) time.</p>
<p>This release also addresses the limitations users face when querying data that was not structured during ingestion. Developers can now conduct ad-hoc analysis by creating fields in their indexed data with the new Piped Processing Language (PPL) Parse() command (combined with regex to query unstructured data). For more information, please see <a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/1.3/observability-plugin/ppl/index/">PPL documentation</a> for PPL Parse.</p>
<p>The new observability capabilities and log monitoring features are available on all Amazon OpenSearch Service domains with OpenSearch version 1.3 or higher across 26 regions globally: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), US West (N. California), Canada (Central), South America (Sao Paulo), Africa (Cape Town), Middle East (Bahrain), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Paris), Europe (Stockholm), Europe (Milan), Asia Pacific (Jakarta), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Osaka), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), AWS China (Beijing) region, operated by Sinnet, AWS China (Ningxia) region, operated by NWCD), and AWS GovCloud (US), .

"<p>Today, we are announcing the next generation storage optimized Amazon EC2 Im4gn and Is4gen instances. These instances are built on the AWS Nitro System and are powered by AWS Graviton2 processors. They feature up to 30TB of storage with the new AWS Nitro SSDs that are custom-designed by AWS to maximize the storage performance of I/O intensive workloads such as SQL/NoSQL databases, search engines, distributed file systems and data analytics which continuously read and write from the SSDs in a sustained manner. AWS Nitro SSDs enable up to 60% lower latency and up to 75% reduced latency variability in Im4gn and Is4gen instances compared to the third generation of storage optimized instances. These instances maximize the number of transactions processed per second (TPS) for I/O intensive workloads such as relational databases (e.g. MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL), and NoSQL databases (KeyDB, ScyllaDB, Cassandra) which have medium-large size data sets and can benefit from high compute performance and high network throughput. They are also an ideal fit for search engines, and data analytics workloads that require very fast access to data sets on local storage.</p>
<p>The Im4gn instances provide the best price performance for storage-intensive workloads in Amazon EC2. They offer up to 40% better price performance and up to 44% lower cost per TB of storage compared to I3 instances for running applications such as MySQL, NoSQL, and file systems, which require dense local SSD storage and higher compute performance. They also feature up to 100 Gbps networking and support for Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) for applications that require high levels of inter-node communication.</p>
<p>The Is4gen instances provide the lowest cost per TB and highest density per vCPU of SSD storage in Amazon EC2 for applications such as stream processing and monitoring, real-time databases, and log analytics, that require high random I/O access to large amounts of local SSD data. These instances enable 15% lower cost per TB of storage and up to 48% better compute performance compared to I3en instances.</p>
<p>AWS Graviton2 processors are custom-built by AWS using 64-bit Arm Neoverse N1 cores to enable the best price performance for cloud workloads running in Amazon EC2.

<p>AWS CDK v2 only includes stable APIs, which comply with Semantic Versioning (semver), so you can confidently update to new minor versions. The CDK follows the “release early, release often” philosophy to encourage community participation, and we will continue deliver new features via experimental APIs for your feedback. However, going forward, experimental modules will be distributed separately from aws-cdk-lib, versioned clearly to indicate their pre-release status, and will only be merged into aws-cdk-lib when mature and stable. </p>

"<p>Today, we are launching Amazon EMR on Amazon EKS support for Pod Templates to make it simple to run Spark jobs on shared EKS clusters. A Pod is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. Pod Templates are specifications which determine how each Pod runs. Customers often consolidate multiple applications on a shared EKS cluster to improve utilization and save costs. However, each application may have different requirements. For example, you may want to run performance intensive workloads such as ML model training jobs on SSD-backed instances for better performance, or ad-hoc workloads on Spot instances for lower cost. You can also schedule a separate logging container to forward logs to your existing monitoring application. With this release, you can use Pod Templates with EMR on EKS to configure how to run Spark jobs on shared EKS clusters.  </p>
<p>To reduce costs, customers can schedule Spark driver pods to run on EC2 On-Demand instances while scheduling Spark executor pods to run on EC2 Spot instances. Kubernetes customers frequently use taints, tolerations and labels to ensure that pods are scheduled onto the right worker nodes. A taint is a property of a worker node that enables it to restrict what pods can run on it. Conversely, a toleration enables a pod to be scheduled over a matching taint. The label is used with <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector">nodeSelectors</a> to direct the pod to the worker. Now, Pod Templates can be used to apply tolerations to the Spark driver pod so it will run on a EC2 On-Demand instance, and a separate toleration for the Spark executor pod so they will only run on EC2 Spot instances.  </p>
<p>To forward logs to your centralized logging application, customers can deploy a sidecar container with their Spark job. A sidecar container is deployed in the same pod as the application container but provides additional functionality. In this case, it forwards job logs. EMR on EKS provides built in log forwarding to Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon S3. However, if a customer wants to forward logs to their own log reporting application, they would deploy a log forwarder as a daemonset. Daemonsets are run directly on the kubernetes worker nodes. Now, Pod Templates can be used to deploy log forwarding as a sidecar container on a per job or per pod basis.  </p>
<p>To increase resource utilization, customers can support multiple teams running their workloads on the same EKS cluster. Frequently, each team will get a designated EC2 node group to run their workloads on. Previously, workloads could only be directed to the right nodegroup using labels and affinity. Customers can apply taints to a team’s nodegroup and now use Pod Templates to apply a corresponding toleration to their workload. This ensures that only the designated team can schedule jobs to their nodegroup.   </p>
<p>To implement team based nodegroup, start with creating a nodegroup that includes a label and a taint representing the team. A taint is a property of a worker node that enables it to restrict what pods can run on it. Conversely, a toleration enables a pod to be scheduled over a matching taint. The label, using affinity, directs the application to the team’s designated nodegroup and a toleration enables it to schedule over the taint. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/pod-templates.html">Create a Pod Template</a> that includes the corresponding toleration and affinity and store it in an S3 bucket that your job can access. Pod Templates can be created for the Spark driver and executor pods to provide different deployment options and you specify the location of the templates during job submission.   </p>

"<p>Today, AWS announced the general availability of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/connected-home">Amazon Rekognition Streaming Video Events</a>, a fully managed service for camera manufacturers and service providers that uses machine learning (ML) to detect objects such as people, pets, and packages in live video streams from connected cameras. Amazon Rekognition Streaming Video Events sends them a notification as soon as the desired object is detected in the live video stream. With these event notifications, service providers can send timely and actionable smart alerts to their users such as “Pet detected in the backyard,” enable home automation experiences such as turning on garage lights when a person is detected, build custom in-app experiences such as a smart search to find specific video events of packages without scrolling through hours of footage, or integrate these alerts with Echo devices for Alexa announcements such as “A package was detected at the front door” when the doorbell detects a delivery person dropping off a package – all while keeping cost and latency low. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-rekognition-introduces-streaming-video-events-to-provide-real-time-alerts-on-live-video-streams/">Learn more</a> about Amazon Rekognition Streaming Video Events.</p>
<p>Many camera manufacturers and security service providers offer home security solutions that include doorbells, indoor and outdoor cameras, and value-added notification services to help their users understand what is happening on their property. Cameras with built-in motion detectors are placed at entry or exit points of the home to notify users of any activity in real time, such as “Motion detected in the backyard.” However, motion detectors are noisy, can be set off by innocuous events like wind and rain, creating notification fatigue, and resulting in clunky home automation setup. Building the right user experience for smart alerts, search, or even browsing video clips requires ML and automation that is hard to get right and can be expensive.  </p>
<p>Amazon Rekognition Streaming Video Events lowers the costs of value-added video analytics by providing a low-cost, low-latency, fully managed ML service that can detect objects (such as people, pets, and packages) in real time on video streams from connected cameras. The service starts analyzing the video clip only when a motion event is triggered by the camera and sends a notification as soon as the desired object is detected. Visit the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/streaming-video-detect-labels.html">Amazon Rekognition Streaming Video Events developer guide</a> to learn more.</p>

"<p>Amazon Timestream has added three new capabilities, namely, scheduled queries, multi-measure records, and magnetic storage writes, to make time series data processing faster, cost-effective, and therefore more accessible to many more customers. These features enable customers to write, store, and access their time series data more economically and efficiently, so they can continue to derive insights from their data and drive better data-driven business decisions.</p>
<p>Starting today, customers can use Amazon Timestream’s Scheduled Queries for faster and more affordable time series data processing. With scheduled queries, customers simply define the queries for computing aggregates, rollups, and other real-time analytics on their data; along with the frequency at which the query must be run. Then, Amazon Timestream periodically and automatically runs the scheduled queries and reliably writes the query results into a configurable destination table, within a few minutes. Customers can then point their dashboards and reports to simply query the destination table, instead of querying the considerably larger source tables. This leads to performance and cost gains that can exceed an order of magnitude or more. This is because destination tables contain much less data than the source tables. Given destination tables contain much less data than source tables, customers can store data in the destination tables for a much longer duration at a fraction of the data storage cost of the source table. They can also choose to reduce the data retention period of their source tables and further optimize their spend. </p>
<p>With this release, Amazon Timestream also supports multi-measure records, a new data modeling capability that enables faster data writes, efficient data storage, performant data access, and ease of use. Multi-measure records enable customers to store multiple time series measures in a single table row, instead of storing one measure per row. This optimized data layout reduces the volume of data stored in a table, which helps customers lower their data storage spend, improve query performance, and minimize the cost of analytical queries. Multi-measure records also make it easy for customers to migrate time series data and queries from existing relational databases to Amazon Timestream with minimal changes. </p>
<p>From today, Amazon Timestream also allows customers to write their late arrival data into the magnetic store, so they can further optimize their data storage spend. Late arrival data is data with a timestamp that is in the past. Customers can now use Amazon Timestream’s existing write APIs to send late arrival data to the magnetic store by simply enabling a property on their tables. With magnetic storage writes, customers no longer have to maintain a memory store with a large data retention period for the purpose of processing late arrival data. Customers can now set their memory store data retention period to match the high throughput data ingestion and fast point-in-time query requirements of their applications. They can use the magnetic store for asynchronous processing of late arrival data, long-term data storage, and for fast analytical queries. </p>
<p>Scheduled Queries, multi-measure records, and magnetic storage writes are now available as part of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/API%5FReference.html">Amazon Timestream’s APIs</a> and the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/timestream/home?region=us-east-1#welcome">AWS Management Console for Amazon Timestream</a>. Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, secure, and purpose-built time series database for Application Monitoring, edge and IoT workloads that can scale to process trillions of time series events per day up to 1,000 times faster than relational databases, and at as low as 1/10th the cost. The service is also HIPAA eligible, ISO certified, PCI DSS compliant, and in scope for AWS’s SOC reports SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3. Amazon Timestream is currently available in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Europe (Ireland), and Europe (Frankfurt). To get started, visit our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/timestream">product page</a>.</p>"

"<p>Amazon Rekognition is a deep-learning-based image and video analysis service that can identify objects, text, scenes, as well as support content moderation by detecting inappropriate content. Starting today, Amazon Rekognition can analyze images to detect if persons in the images are wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as face covers (face masks), hand covers (gloves), and head covers (helmets or hard hats).   </p>
<p>Safety hazards can exist in every workplace in many different forms: sharp edges, falling objects, flying sparks, chemicals, noise, and a myriad of other potentially dangerous situations. Safety regulators such as <a href="https://www.osha.gov/">Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)</a> and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=148&langId=en">European Commission</a> often require that businesses protect their employees and customers from hazards that can cause injury by providing them personal protective equipment (PPE) and ensuring their use. Across several industries such as manufacturing, food processing, chemical, healthcare, energy, and logistics improving workplace safety is usually a top priority. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, wearing PPE in public places has become important to reduce the spread of the virus. However, even when people do their best to follow PPE guidelines, sometimes they can inadvertently forget to wear PPE or not realize it is required in the area they are present in. This puts their safety at potential risk and opens businesses to possible regulatory compliance issues. Today, businesses rely on site supervisors or superintendents to individually check and remind all the people present in the designated areas to wear PPE, which is not reliable, effective, or cost-efficient at scale.   </p>
<p>With Amazon Rekognition PPE detection, customers can analyze images from their on-premises cameras across multiple locations to automatically detect if persons in the images are wearing the required PPE. When customers analyze an image using Amazon Rekognition PPE detection, for each person detected in the image, they receive confidence scores with bounding boxes for each item of protective equipment detected (face cover, hand covers, and head cover) and Boolean responses (true or false) with confidence scores for whether each detected item of protective equipment covers the corresponding body part (nose, hands, and head). They can also supply a list of required protective equipment (such as face cover or face cover and head cover) and a minimum confidence threshold (such as 80%) to receive a consolidated per-image summary of Persons with Required PPE, Persons without Required PPE, and Persons Indeterminate. Using these PPE detection results, customers can trigger timely alarms or notifications that remind people to wear PPE before or during their presence in a hazardous area in order to help improve or maintain everyone’s safety. They can also aggregate the PPE detection results and analyze them by time and place to identify how safety warnings or training practices can be improved and generate reports for use during regulatory audits. Note that Amazon Rekognition PPE detection does not perform facial recognition or facial comparison and cannot identify the detected persons.  </p>
